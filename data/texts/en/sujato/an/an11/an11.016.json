  "an11.16:6.4": "“Sir, Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and determined mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary?”",
  "an11.16:6.5": "“There is, householder.”",
  "an11.16:7.1": "“And what is that one thing?”",
  "an11.16:7.2": "“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",

  "an11.16:7.7": "If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.",

  "an11.16:9.2": "In the same way they spread a heart full of love above, below, across, everywhere, all around—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.",
  "an11.16:9.3": "Then they reflect: ",
  "an11.16:9.4": "‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’",
