He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life. Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes. But on hearing from Mahānāma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go. He could not, however, get his mother’s consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him.

He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them. <span class='ref'>SN.v.299–306</span> He himself considered the divine eye as the highest attainment. Thus in the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.i.213</span> he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.</p><p>Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in Sāvatthī, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>. <span class='ref'>SN.v.302</span> Apart from his teaching of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher. He was of a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks’ quarrels.</p><p>Mention is often made of Anuruddha’s <i>iddhi</i>-powers.

There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ānanda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.220<em>f.</em></span> It was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.293</span></p><p>During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them.

Their abandoned ways of life won popularity for them, and virtuous monks, who did not belong to their group, were not welcomed by the people of the neighbourhood.</p><p>The Buddha heard of their nefarious doings from a monk who had been sojourning in the district, and having convened a meeting of the Saṅgha, sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna, together with a number of other monks, (for the recalcitrant were passionate and violent), to carry out the <i>Pabbājanīyakamma</i> (Act of Banishment) against them. The deputation of the Saṅgha went to Kīṭāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kīṭāgiri, but also left the Order.

It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were “even gladdened in their hearts” after hearing the Buddha.

Several incidents connected with him are mentioned in the Vinaya. Once he promised to spend the rainy season with Pasenadi Kosala, but on his way there he saw two lodgings where robes were plentiful and so kept Vassa in those lodgings instead. Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.153</span> On another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī, but when the time came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.300</span> His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a meal by an official, a follower of the Ājīvakas. He went late, and finding no room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a great uproar, but Upananda had his way. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.165</span> Elsewhere he is accused of having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at Sāvatthī and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as “a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions.”. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.168</span> Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.297</span> a statement to the effect that “on the occasion of the matter of Upananda the Sākyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden.” Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain</p><p>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was given to him. Upananda insisted that a kahāpaṇa should be paid to him in lieu of the meat. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.236<em>f.</em></span> Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, and said he would accept no other. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.215</span> A story is also told of a Paribbājaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was of rich colour. Two other Paribbājakas told him that he had lost in the bargain, so he wished to cry off the deal, but Upananda positively refused. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.240<em>f.</em></span> He did not, however, always come off best in a bargain.

This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.290</span> though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.184<em>f.</em></span> In the Sutta Nipāta <span class='ref'>Snp.1010–1013</span> the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.</p><p>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.290<em>f.</em></span> The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṃsapāvana in Kosambī. <span class='ref'>SN.v.437</span></p><p>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—​​the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.</p><p>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṃsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.337–3​57</span> The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna <span class='ref'>Ud.iv.5</span> and in the Saṃyutta, <span class='ref'>SN.iii.94</span> but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.</p><p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.298</span></p><p>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.307</span></p><p>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class='ref'>SN.iv.179</span> as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.</p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>25.338984,81.392899</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>town</span></dd></dl>"

It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā <span class='ref'>D.ii.141</span>. This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues <span class='ref'>MA.i.388</span>; <span class='ref'>Bu.A.242</span>, etc., but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka Upaka.</p><p>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya <span class='ref'>Vin.i.189</span>, and between there and Takkasilā <span class='ref'>DhA.i.123</span>. It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā <span class='ref'>E.g., J.ii.4</span>; <span class='ref'>DhA.i.250</span>, but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (<span class='ref'>KhA.198</span>; see also <span class='ref'>DhA.iii.445</span>, where Susīma, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).</p><p>From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli <span class='ref'>Sp.i.201</span>. On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda <span class='ref'>Vin.i.220</span>. There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares <span class='ref'>Vin.i.275</span>. The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river <span class='ref'>MA.ii.929</span>.</p><p>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated E.g., <span class='ref'>J.iv.377</span>; <span class='ref'>J.vi.160</span>; <span class='ref'>MA.ii.608</span> to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).</p><p>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu <span class='ref'>D.ii.235</span>. The Ceylon Chronicles <span class='ref'>MT. 127,129,130</span> mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara <span class='ref'>J.iv.119f</span>; and in that of the Sankha, Molinī <span class='ref'>J.iv.15</span>. It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura E.g., <span class='ref'>J.v.54</span>; <span class='ref'>J.vi.165</span>; <span class='ref'>DhA.i.87</span>, being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka <span class='ref'>J.i.178</span> says that 'all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.' In the Brahāchatta Jātaka <span class='ref'>J.iii.116</span>, the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name <span class='ref'>J.ii.403</span>.</p><p>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kos.</p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>25.2993376,83.0044556</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>town</span></dd></dl>"

It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghaṭīkāra’s house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghaṭīkāra’s piety. Once, when Ghaṭīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha’s suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata. For three months Ghaṭīkāra’s house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith.</p><p>The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghaṭīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghaṭīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghaṭīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force. Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghaṭīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world.

In one passage in the Vinaya, <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.189</span> Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta, the son of Godhi.</p><p>When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiya and entered the Order. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.182</span> During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of <i>iddhi</i> possible to those who are yet of the world <i>puthujjānika-<i>iddhi</i></i>. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.183</span> Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about Rājagaha singing Devadatta’s praises. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.189</span> Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.156</span> About eight years before the Buddha’s death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha’s fame, attempted to win over Ajātasattu. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.184<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.171<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.174<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.71</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.123</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.402</span> <span class='ref'>AN.ii.73</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.160</span></p><p>He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu’s lap, frightening him. He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.</p><p>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha’s approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, “Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?” <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.188</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.393</span> Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha’s suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Saṅgha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.</p><p>It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha’s majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his <i>iddhi</i>-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great <i>iddhi</i>-power.</p><p>Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha’s foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka’s Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.</p><p>Devadatta’s next attempt on the Buddha’s life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.</p><p>This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Saṅgha.</p><ol><li>that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, </li><li>that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, </li><li>that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, </li><li>that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof, </li><li> that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh. </li></ol><p>The Buddha’s reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules—​​except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season—​​but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha’s warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Ānanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa. Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.</p><p>The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika’s warning, welcomed them. That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sāriputta to address the assembly. Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kokālika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill.</p><p>As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci.</p><p>Only once is mention made <span class='ref'>AN.iv.402<em>f.</em></span> of the text of a sermon by Devadatta. Candikāputta reports this to Sāriputta, who makes it an occasion for a talk to the monks.</p></dd></dl>"

Devadatta, after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Ajātasattu’s consent to use Nālagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha’s death. Nālagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror. Ānanda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha’s orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. The Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal’s forehead. Thrilling with joy at the touch, Nālāgiri sank on his knees before the Buddha. The Buddha returned to Veḷuvana. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.194<em>f.</em></span></p></dd></dl>"

By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedanā. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond the round of existence. It is said that Nāṭaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word daṇḍa; and that, according to him, the daṇḍa of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. <span class='ref'>MN.i.371</span></p><p>He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death <span class='ref'>SN.iv.398</span> ; but Sakuludāyi says <span class='ref'>MN.ii.31</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.93</span> <span class='ref'>MN.ii.214<em>f.</em></span> that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.</p><p>Only one discussion is recorded between Nāṭaputta and a follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchika Sanda. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.298<em>ff.</em></span> He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four <i>jhānas</i>, Nāṭaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him.</p><p>The Devadaha Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.ii.214</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.91<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.150</span> <span class='ref'>DN.iii.119</span> contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Nigaṇṭhas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Nigaṇṭhas are fruitless.</p><p>The books contain the names of several disciples of Nāṭaputta, among them a deva called Ninka. <span class='ref'>SN.i.66</span> Nāṭaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like Dīgha Tapassī, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta <span class='ref'>SN.iv.317<em>ff.</em></span> and Abhayarājakumāra. <span class='ref'>MN.i.392<em>ff.</em></span> Nāṭaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Sīha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.180<em>ff.</em></span> Sīha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served. It is said that Nāṭaputta went about Vesāli, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.233<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>But the greatest blow to Nāṭaputta was when Upāli-gahapati <span class='ref'>MN.i.373<em>ff.</em></span> joined the Buddha. Nāṭaputta had allowed Upāli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dīgha-Tapassī as to the Buddha’s arresting personality. But Nāṭaputta thought Upāli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Nigaṇṭhas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Upāli prostrated him with grief.; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bālaka, where he was then living, to Pāvā. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers.

Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.24</span></p><p>All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the Ājīvakas their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching, <span class='ref'>MN.i.64f</span> <span class='ref'>MN.i.84<em>f.</em></span> but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated <span class='ref'>Vin.i.39</span> in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under Sañjaya. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.35<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.378</span> <span class='ref'>AN.i.215</span></p><p>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, for instance, and described as those of “Eel wrigglers” and “Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbājakas, such as those in Mallikā’s park at Sāvatthī, <span class='ref'>DN.i.178</span> and the Kūṭāgārasālā at Vesāli.</p><p>Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the groves near the settlements, as at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā lake, <span class='ref'>DN.i.111</span> at the Moranivāpa in Rājagaha, <span class='ref'>AN.v.326</span> and on the banks of the Sappinikā. <span class='ref'>AN.i.185</span> <span class='ref'>AN.ii.175</span></p><p>It was in such places that the Paribbājakas met each other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion. The utmost cordiality seems to have prevailed on these occasions, intercourse and discussions were free, there were no restrictions of creed, caste or pride. Thus Dīghanakha calls on the Buddha, <span class='ref'>MN.i.497</span> the Buddha on Sakuladāyī <span class='ref'>MN.ii.29</span> <span class='ref'>AN.ii.175<em>ff.</em></span> and Sarabha. <span class='ref'>AN.i.185</span> Vekhanassa calls on the Buddha, <span class='ref'>MN.ii.40</span> as do Timbaruka, <span class='ref'>SN.ii.22</span> Vacchagotta, <span class='ref'>SN.iii.257</span> and Sivaka Moliya. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.230</span> Potaliputta calls on Samiddhi, <span class='ref'>MN.iii.207</span> Susīma on Ānanda, <span class='ref'>SN.ii.119</span> and Jambukhādaka on Sāriputta. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.251</span></p><p>The inhabitants of the towns and villager, near which the Paribbājakas stopped, visited them, both to show their respect and to benefit by their teachings. The names of a considerable number of Paribbājakas, besides those already mentioned, who were well known in the time of the Buddha, are given in the texts e.g., Annabhāra, Varadhara, etc., <span class='ref'>AN.ii.175</span> also Sāmaṇḍaka, <span class='ref'>SN.iv.26</span> and the Paribbājikā Sucimukhī. <span class='ref'>SN.iii.238<em>f.</em></span> In most cases they are represented as having large followings, so that they were evidently regarded as distinguished teachers.</p></dd></dl>"

Although it later became the capital of Magadha, it was then a mere village. At that time Ajātasattu's ministers, Sunīdha and Vassakāra, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the Vajjīs. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha <span class='ref'>Vin.i.226 30</span>; <span class='ref'>D.ii.86ff</span>.</p><p>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain. Hiouen Thsang seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu <span class='ref'>Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1</span>. The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya <span class='ref'>iii.57</span> even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, however, in the time of Asoka that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council <span class='ref'>Sp.i.52</span>.</p><p>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta <span class='ref'>M.i.349</span>; <span class='ref'>A.v.341</span>; <span class='ref'>A.iii.57</span>; <span class='ref'>S.v.15f.</span>, <span class='ref'>S.v.171f</span>. At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly hall for the monks in the city <span class='ref'>M.ii.163</span>.</p><p>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence.

The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha’s sanction. The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later. On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arāmikagāma or Pilindagāma. One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any. Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold. The king’s officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison. The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his <i>iddhi</i> powers by turning the whole palace into gold. The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.206<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.248<em>ff.</em></span> This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days.</p><p>Another story is related of Pilinda’s <i>iddhi</i> powers. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.67</span> Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped.

The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.165</span> Each had their Mote Hall.</p><p>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.126<em>f.</em></span> From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.166</span> The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.167</span></p><p>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. <span class='ref'>MN.i.231</span> The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.</p><p>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—​​e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.</p><p>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—​​e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.</p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>26.739416,83.890041</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>janapada</span></dd></dl>"

He gave him a brief teaching: <span class='ref'>SN.ii.220</span> ‘There shall be a lively sense of conscience and regard towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.’ ‘Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it, pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.’ ‘Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall not be neglected by me.’</p><p>The Buddha exchanged his worn robes for Kassapa’s, which was regarded as a unique honor. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.221</span></p><p>Kassapa was not present at the death of the Buddha; as he was journeying from Pāvā to Kusināra he met an Ājīvaka carrying in his hand a <i>mandārava</i> flower picked up by him from among those which had rained from heaven in honour of the Buddha, and it was he who told Kassapa the news. It was then the seventh day after the Buddha’s death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre. The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mahā Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha’s feet. Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha’s feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them. He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.163<em>f.</em></span></p><p>At Pāvā (on the announcement of the Buddha’s death), Kassapa had heard the words of Subhadda, who, in his old age, had joined the Order, that they were “well rid of the great samaṇa and could now do as they liked.” This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa’s mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha’s teachings. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya.</p><p>The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa—​​he is classed with Moggallāna, Kappina, and Anuruddha for his great <i>iddhi</i>-powers. <span class='ref'>SN.i.114</span></p><p>The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives, <span class='ref'>SN.ii.205</span> and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment <span class='ref'>SN.ii.194<em>f.</em></span> and his ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the moon, unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.197<em>ff.</em></span> The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the <i>jhānas</i> and abiding therein. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.210<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them. <span class='ref'>Thag.1051–1057</span> <span class='ref'>Thag.1072–10​81</span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.161<em>ff.</em></span> But he would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.203<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>SN.ii.219</span></p><p>He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ānanda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among certain nuns, for, at the end of his discourse, Thullatissā openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ānanda, “as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.”. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.215<em>f.</em></span> Kassapa was very careful of the good name of the Order, and we find him <span class='ref'>SN.ii.218<em>f.</em></span> blaming Ānanda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. “A corn trampler art thou, Ānanda,” he says, “a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,” and ends up with “The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.” Ānanda, annoyed at being called “boy,” protests “Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.” Ānanda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.92<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ānanda and raised her voice in protest, “What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ānanda?” Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ānanda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.</p><p>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.224<em>f.</em></span> At the First Council, when Ānanda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.287<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta, <span class='ref'>MN.i.214</span> where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of Somamitta who, finding his own teacher Vimala given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.</p><p>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.202<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at Pipphaliguhā, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven bojjhangas which he had practised. <span class='ref'>SN.v.78</span></p><p>Kassapa had special compassion for the poor and would sgo to the poorest families to seek alms. <span class='ref'>Ud.iii.7</span></p><p> Sāriputta seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the Kassapa Saṃyutta contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna, <span class='ref'>SN.ii.195<em>f.</em></span> and the other on the existence of a Tathāgata after death. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.222<em>f.</em></span> This regard was mutual, for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song. <span class='ref'>Thag.1082–1085</span></p></dd></dl>"

When the Buddha was staying at Kapilavatthu she approached the Buddha with 500 Sakyan ladies and asked leave to be ordained as nuns. The Buddha did not acquiesce, and he went on to Vesāli. But Pajāpatī and her companions cut off their hair, and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot. They arrived with sore feet at the Buddha’s monastery and repeated their request. The Buddha again refused, but Ānanda interceded on their behalf and Mahāpajāpatī’s ordination was granted on condition that she abide by eight rules of respect. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.253<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.274<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>After her ordination, Pajāpatī came to the Buddha and worshipped him. The Buddha preached to her and gave her a subject for meditation. With this topic she developed insight and soon after won arahantship, while her five hundred companions attained to the same after listening to the Nandakovāda Sutta. Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in Jetavana, the Buddha declared Pajāpatī chief of those who were long ordained. <span class='ref'>AN.i.25</span></p><p>It is said that once Pajāpatī made a robe for the Buddha of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate. But when it came to be offered to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a whole. Pajāpatī was greatly disappointed, and Ānanda intervened. But the Buddha explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajāpatī, and also as an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga Sutta. <span class='ref'>MN.iii.253<em>ff.</em></span> The Buddha had a great love for Pajāpatī, and when she lay ill, as there were no monks to visit her and preach to her the Buddha went himself to preach to her. <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.56</span></p><p>Her Therīgāthā verses speak of offering homage to the Buddha, and how she had been a relative of his in many past lives.

He and Sāriputta went forth as disciples of Sañjaya. After some time, Sāriputta, wandering about in Rājagaha, met Assaji, was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a <i>sotāpanna</i>. He found Moggallāna and repeated the stanza he had heard from Assaji <i>ye dhammā hetuppabhavā</i>, etc., and Moggallāna also became a <i>sotāpanna</i>. The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at Veḷuvana, after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Sañjaya to accompany them. Sañjaya’s disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veḷuvana. The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by saying, ”Come, monks.” <span class='ref'>Vin.i.39<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla <span class='ref'>AN.iv.85<em>f.</em></span> in Māgadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating. The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous. That very day he attained arahantship.</p><p>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow.<span class='ref'>SN.ii.235</span> <span class='ref'>AN.i.88</span> In the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.iii.248</span> the Buddha thus distinguishes these “twin brethren” from the others— “Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.” Moggallāna’s pre eminence lay in his possession of psychic power. <span class='ref'>AN.i.23</span> He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. <span class='ref'>Thag.1183</span> When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in Verañja, Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from Nalerupu, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.7</span></p><p>Several instances are given of this special display of <i>iddhi</i>. Once, at the Buddha’s request, with his great toe he shook the Migāramātupāsāda, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper story. <span class='ref'>SN.v.269<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited Sakka to find out if he had profited by the Buddha’s teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakka’s palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka’s hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled. <span class='ref'>MN.i.251<em>ff.</em></span> Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhamma-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. <span class='ref'>Thag.1198</span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.144<em>f.</em></span> Other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.331<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.75<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.i.332<em>ff.</em></span> we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kāḷī was the mother of the present Māra. Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.</p><p>Moggallāna could see petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.254<em>ff.</em></span> We are told <span class='ref'>SN.v.366<em>f.</em></span> that Moggallāna’s visits to the deva worlds were very welcome to the devas.</p><p>The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna’s powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.183<em>ff.</em></span> Mention is made elsewhere <span class='ref'>SN.iv.262–26​9</span> of eloquent sermons preached by him on the <i>jhānas</i>, on qualities which lead to true emancipation, <span class='ref'>AN.v.155<em>ff.</em></span> and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him—​​e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti <span class='ref'>SN.iv.269–2​80</span> He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta, <span class='ref'>SN.iv.391<em>ff.</em></span> and Vappa, <span class='ref'>AN.ii.196<em>ff.</em></span> eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.204<em>ff.</em></span> Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ānanda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself. <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.236</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.374</span></p><p>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk.<span class='ref'>AN.v.170<em>ff.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Snp.p.231<em>ff.</em></span> When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back. They were successful in this mission. Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta’s intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna.<span class='ref'>Vin.ii.185</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iii.122<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare.

Vaṅgīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.</p><p>The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sāriputta’s verses in praise of Moggallāna <span class='ref'>Thag.1178–11​81</span> are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta. <span class='ref'>Thag.1176</span> Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.275<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna elsewhere also <span class='ref'>SN.ii.273<em>f.</em></span> tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For another discussion between Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see. <span class='ref'>AN.ii.154<em>f.</em></span></p><p>In the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.i.212</span> we find them staying in the Gosiṅgasālavana in the company of Mahā Kassapa, Ānanda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion. Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned <span class='ref'>SN.v.174<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>SN.v.299</span> as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i>. <span class='ref'>SN.v.294<em>f.</em></span> It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.336</span> <span class='ref'>AN.iv.63</span></p><p>Sāriputta dies before Moggallāna. The Theragāthā contains several verses attributed to Moggallāna regarding Sāriputta’s death. <span class='ref'>Thag.1158–1161</span> Moggallāna evidently dies before the Buddha, as the Saṃyutta contains a reference to the Buddha speaking of them both as dead. However the early texts contain no record of the circumstances of Moggallāna’s death.</p></dd></dl>"

By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha.

The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world under the sway of death” <span class='ref'>AN.iv.228</span> and the beings therein. Thence, the <i>kilesas</i> also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the <i>kilesas</i> were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a <i>devaputta</i> of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p><p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the <i>kilesas</i>, and the world over which Death and the <i>kilesas</i> hold sway. <span class='ref'>SN.iv.91</span> <span class='ref'>SN.iii.73</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.8</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.40</span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.135</span></p><p>The legend of Māra attacking the Buddha to prevent his Awakening had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta. <span class='ref'>Snp.494–517</span> There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjara, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage. He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p><p>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta <span class='ref'>Snp.446<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>SN.i.122</span> is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.”</p><p>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class='ref'>SN.i.124<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>AN.v.46</span> also contains a sutta in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.</p><p>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.</p><p>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.22</span> On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. <span class='ref'>SN.i.67</span> In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta. <span class='ref'>MN.i.326</span> Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants of the Brahma world. The Māra Saṃyutta <span class='ref'>SN.i.103<em>ff.</em></span> contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūṭa fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers. <span class='ref'>DN.iii.58</span> In the account of Godhika’s suicide <span class='ref'>SN.i.122</span> there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his consciousness, and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, “going about like a cloud of smoke.”</p><p>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots—​​e.g., Āḷavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.</p><p>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.</p><p>With the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual <i>devaputta</i>, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmitā Vasavatti deva world. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, Māra is described as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds. <span class='ref'>AN.ii.17</span> In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <span class='ref'>MN.i.333</span> <span class='ref'>DN.iii.79</span> Moggallāna says that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.</p></dd></dl>"

They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas).</p><p>Elsewhere <span class='ref'>AN.ii.38</span> they rank, in progressive order, between <i>manussā</i> and <i>gandhabbā</i>. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, <i>yakkha</i>, like <i>nāga</i>, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to, <span class='ref'>MN.i.252</span> but even the Buddha is spoken of as a <i>yakkha</i> in poetic diction. <span class='ref'>MN.i.386</span> Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed. <span class='ref'>SN.i.54</span> Of these above named, the followers of Vessavaṇa appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term <i>yakkha</i> as applied to <i>purisa</i> is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning “soul” in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi, <span class='ref'>Snp.478</span> or <i>ettāvat’ aggam no vadanti h’ ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha paṇḍitāse</i>. <span class='ref'>Snp.875</span></p><p>The cult of <i>yakkhas</i> seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva’s supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called <i>devatā</i> <span class='ref'>SN.i.205</span> or <i>devaputta</i>. Some of these, like Indakūta and Sūciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.</p><p>Sometimes the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood and devour even men. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.346</span></p><p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta, <span class='ref'>DN.iii.194<em>f.</em></span> however, the Yakkha king, Vessavaṇa, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta. <span class='ref'>Ud.iv.4</span> But the Mahā Yakkhas, <span class='ref'>DN.iii.204<em>f.</em></span> the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are <i>sotāpannas</i>—​​e.g., Janavasabha, Sūciloma and Khara. The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāṇi is of special interest. <i>D.i.95</i> He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambaṭṭha, if he does not answer the Buddha’s question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are “fallen angels” and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyaṅkaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavaṇa, listening to Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.63</span> At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.</p><p>The names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc. e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Āḷavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāṇi or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc. e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Puṇṇaka, Māra, Sakaṭa; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Paṇḍaka, Sīvaka, Serī.</p><p>Vessavaṇa is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta <span class='ref'>DN.iii.199<em>ff.</em></span> contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavaṇa is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers. They wait upon him in turn.</p><p>No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavaṇa. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.207</span> The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies. <span class='ref'>DN.iii.201</span></p><p>It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas were non-humans spirits or aboriginal tribespeople.

Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming— “Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!” The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, “Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger.” Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma. To Yasa’s father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha’s follower, and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, therefore, Yasa’s presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The next day, at the invitation of Yasa’s father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa’s mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā. When Yasa’s intimate friends, Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa’s ordination they followed his example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa’s former friends and acquaintances. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.15–20</span></p><p>A verse attributed to him in the Theragāthā says that he attained the Three Knowledges even while still adorned with fine clothes. <span class='ref'>Thag.117</span></p></dd><dt><dfn id='Yasa2'>Yasa</dfn><sup>2</sup></dt><dt>Kākandakaputta</dt><dd><p>A monk who lived about a century after the Buddha, and who was one of the leaders in the events of the Second Council. When he arrived at the Kūṭāgārasālā in the Mahāvana, he discovered that the Vajjian monks had raised the “Ten Points” contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.</p><p>This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the <i>Patisārattiyakamma</i> (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha’s discourses to prove his charge.</p><p>When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the <i>Ukkhepaniyakamma</i> (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhiṇāpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult Revata who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Saṅkassa, Kaṇṇakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti. Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.</p><p>Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sāḷha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly.

When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samādhi, remaining thus throughout the night. Āmaṇḍa could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samādhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samādhi than to indulge in mere conversation.</p><p>His Theragāthā verses speak in praise of a thin monk who is dedicated and content, while criticizing those who live in company. <span class='ref'>Thag.243–24​5</span></p><p>The Vinaya relates <span class='ref'>Vin.i.239</span> how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers.

His parents would not, however, give their consent till he threatened to starve himself to death. Realizing then that he was in earnest, they agreed to let him go on condition that he would visit them after his ordination. Raṭṭhapāla accompanied the Buddha to Sāvatthī, and there, dwelling alone, he attained arahantship within a short time. Then, with the Buddha’s permission, he returned to Thullakoṭṭhita and dwelt in the deer park of the Kuru king. The day after his arrival, while begging for alms, he came to his father’s house. His father was in the entrance hall having his hair combed, but, failing to recognize his son, he started to abuse him, taking him for an ordinary monk, one of those who had robbed him of his son. Just at that moment the slave girl of the house was about to throw away some stale rice, which Raṭṭhapāla begged of her. The girl recognized his voice, gave him the rice and told his parents who he was. When his father came to look for his son, he found him eating stale rice. Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so, but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life. “For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters,” he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as “Sisters.” Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them. <span class='ref'>MN.i.64<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Thag.769–7​75</span> on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Migacīra.</p><p>There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Raṭṭhapāla’s fame, visited him.

It is said <span class='ref'>MN.iii.68</span> that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. <span class='ref'>SN.ii.191</span> The Saṃyutta <span class='ref'>SN.i.206</span> mentions another peak near Rājagaha—​​Indakūta.</p><p>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work.

Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.35<em>ff.</em></span> Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families.

Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there.

They also practised seven conditions of welfare, which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sārandada cetiya. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.73<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of archery, for mention is made <span class='ref'>AN.iii.76</span> of large numbers of them roving about in the Mahāvana, with bows and arrows, the strings set, and surrounded by hounds. They were a martial people and fond of “sport,” but we find one of their Elders, Mahānāma complaining <span class='ref'>AN.iii.76</span> of them to the Buddha— “The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc. they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back.” Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband’s request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered. <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.225</span></p><p>According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Piṅgiyāni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.239</span> Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.76</span> There were numerous shrines in Vesāli itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cāpāla, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Gotama, Sārandada and Udena. It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves that Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kūṭāgārasālā in Mahāvana. There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes <span class='ref'>AN.v.133<em>f.</em></span> disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosiṅgasālavana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion. <span class='ref'>AN.iii.167<em>f.</em></span></p><p>But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger. <span class='ref'>MN.i.229</span> Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahānāma, Sīha, Bhaddiya, Sāḷha, Abhaya, Panditakumāra, Nandaka, Mahāli and Ugga. Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order—​​e.g., the famous courtesan Ambapālī, Jentī, Sīha and Vāsitthī, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta and Sambhūta.</p><p>The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government. It was a republic (<i>gaṇa</i>, <i>saṅghā</i>), all the leading members of which were called <i>rājā</i>. They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. The Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These are given at. <span class='ref'>DN.ii.76<em>f.</em></span> <span class='ref'>Vin.i.56</span></p><p>In their political relationships with their neighbours, the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisāra, king of Māgadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala. <span class='ref'>MN.ii.101</span></p><p>After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, in his desire for the expansion of Māgadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis.

The Buddha predicted <span class='ref'>DN.ii.72<em>ff.</em></span> that as long as the Licchavis remained united they were proof against any foe.

He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals; his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier. The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him. After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to Kāḷasilā on Isigili. The Buddha was on Gijjhakūṭa and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to “obtain release.” The Buddha sent word to him— “Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil.” Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha’s message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other <i>khandhas</i>, he drew a knife and killed himself. The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibbāna and that Māra’s attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.</p></dd></dl>"

Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.</p><p>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—​​Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—​​did not.</p><p>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.</p><p>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.</p><p>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.1–11</span> The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.172<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class='ref'>AN.ii.57<em>f.</em></span> contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside.

The devas meet and deliberate in the Sudhamma sabhā and Sakka consults with them rather than issues them commands.

His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, he is still subject to death and rebirth <span class='ref'>AN.i.144</span> ; as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka, <span class='ref'>AN.iv.105</span> a statement confirmed by the Buddha. <span class='ref'>AN.iv.89</span></p><p>In the Sakkapañha Sutta, Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasaṇḍā and to have asked him a series of questions.

It is stated in the course of the sutta <span class='ref'>DN.ii.270</span> that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthī, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavaṇa, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares <span class='ref'>DN.ii.286</span> that he has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akaniṭṭhā world, whence he will pass entirely away. Sakka admits <span class='ref'>DN.ii.284</span> that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew.</p><p>An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta. There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha’s answer and leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha’s teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallāna then frightens him by a display of <i>iddhi</i>-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for word, the Buddha’s answer. Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallāna is a “fellow of his” in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.</p><p>In a passage in the Saṃyutta. <span class='ref'>SN.i.201</span> Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in another <span class='ref'>SN.iv.269<em>f.</em></span> as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna’s exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman.

Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent.

He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Māgadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds. When Sanaṅkumāra has finished his address, Vessavaṇa wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future.

The king thereupon asked Sāgata to show them a greater marvel, and Sāgata, having shown in the open sky wonders of various kinds, fell at the Buddha’s feet and declared the Buddha his teacher. <span class='ref'>Vin.i.179<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Later, when the Buddha went to stay in Bhaddavatikā, having heard men warn the Buddha of the proximity of a Nāga of great power in the Jaṭila hermitage at Ambatiṭṭha, Sāgata went there and lived in the Nāga’s abode. The Nāga showed great resentment, but Sāgata overpowered him with his <i><i>iddhi</i></i> and then returned to Bhaddavatikā. From there he went with the Buddha to Kosambī, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great honour. When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, but the Chabbaggiyā suggested that they should provide him with white spirits.</p><p>The next day, when Sāgata went for alms, he was invited to various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks. So deep were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the gateway. The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his condition to the monks, using it as an example of the evil effects of liquor; and he made this the occasion for the passing of a rule against the use of alcohol. <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.108<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Buddha later declared him foremost among those skilled in the contemplation of the heat element. <span class='ref'>AN.i.25</span></p></dd></dl>"

Soṇa then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood “like a slaughter house for oxen.” After Soṇa attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining. Soṇa said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a retinue of seven elephants. He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries which his colleagues did not share. The Buddha then gave permission to all monks to wear shoes with one lining.</p></dd><dt><dfn id='Soṇa3'>Soṇa</dfn><sup>3</sup></dt><dt>Potirīyaputta</dt><dt>Poṭiriyaputta</dt><dt>Seṭṭhiputta</dt><dd><p>A monk whose Theragāthā verse says that the night is for striving, not sleeping. <span class='ref'>Thag.193–194</span></p></dd><dt><dfn id='Soṇa4'>Soṇa</dfn><sup>4</sup></dt><dd><p>A layman of Rājagaha.
