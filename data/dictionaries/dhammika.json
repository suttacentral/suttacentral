A thoroughbred was called <em>assājāniya</em> <span class='ref'>A.i.77</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.124</span>, a nag <em>assakhaluṅka</em> <span class='ref'>A.i.287</span>, a mare <em>vaḷavā</em> <span class='ref'>M.ii.153</span> and a foal <em>assapotaka</em> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.288</span>.

The Kathiawari, India’s indigenous horse, was probably derived from the cross-breeding of Sindh and Arab horses in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Horses were too expensive to be used for ordinary transport and were reserved mainly for royalty,for chariots and for cavalry during war. Chariots and cavalry were two of the four branches of the army. The importance of horses in ancient India is suggested by the space given to their care, maintenance and training in the <em>Arthaśāstra</em>.</p><p>A horse fit for a king was expected to have five qualities; to have a good stud line, when given food, whether green or dried, it should eat it carefully and not scatter it about, it will not lay in its own dung, it should not fight with the other horses, it should show itself as it is to its trainer, and it should pull the carriage properly <span class='ref'>A.iv.188</span>. Horses were trained using gentle means, harsh means and a combination of both <span class='ref'>A.ii.110</span>. This is similar of the <em>Aśvaṣāstra’s</em> advice that a combination of gentleness, rewards and punishment is the best way of training horses. Horses were trained in special grounds and were penned either in stables or in circular corrals and fed steamed rice <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.5</span>. We read of the best three-year-old rice fed to a king’s Sindh horse <span class='ref'>Ja.i.178</span>. A good horse would respond even to the shadow of the whip <span class='ref'>A.ii.113</span> and a thoroughbred was expected to be endowed with beauty, stamina, speed <span class='ref'>A.i.243</span> and be finely proportioned <span class='ref'>A.i.288</span>. A highly-strung horse would not move when urged on, upset the carriage, kick up its hind legs and break the shafts, rear up in the air and pull at the bit <span class='ref'>A.iv.190</span>. Ropes and cords were made out of horsehair <span class='ref'>A.iv.129</span> <span class='ref'>S.ii.238</span> as were sieves <span class='ref'>M.i.229</span>, brushes <span class='ref'>A.i.209</span> and bird snares <span class='ref'>Ja.v.362</span> and couches were stuffed with it <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.170</span>. Being able to judge a good horse was a respected skill and horsemanship was an art taught to princes <span class='ref'>A.iii.152</span> <span class='ref'>A.iii.326</span>. The Vedic horse sacrifice (<em>assamedha</em>) was still being performed by kings <span class='ref'>A.ii.42</span> <span class='ref'>S.i.76</span> and fights between stallions were arranged for entertainment <span class='ref'>D.i.7</span>.

Like other figs, it grows from a tiny seed into a huge tree <span class='ref'>S.v.96</span>. It was said that a woman’s heart beats on seeing her son “as the tender leaves of the <em>assattha</em> tremble in the breeze” <span class='ref'>Ja.v.328</span>.</p><p>The <em>assattha</em> was considered sacred in India centuries before the Buddha and is represented in seals from Mohenjodaro dating from before 1000 BCE. The Buddha stated that he had attained enlightenment at the foot of an <em>assattha</em> tree <span class='ref'>D.ii.4</span> and the actual one he was sitting under at the time was sometimes called “The Tree of Knowledge” (<em>Jñānadruma</em>, <span class='ref'>Bc.13.65</span>). This tree is referred to in the four Nikāyas as “The Tree of Awakening” (<em>Bodhirukkha</em>) although it is only mentioned twice (<span class='ref'>D.ii.4</span> <span class='ref'>Ud.1</span> repeated at <span class='ref'>Vin.i.1</span>) in the earliest part of the Tipiṭaka.</p><p>Before the Buddha’s enlightenment, the area around the Bodhi Tree was covered with silvery sand without a blade of grass growing on it and all the surrounding trees and flowering shrubs were bending as if in homage towards it <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.233</span>. According to the Nidānakathā, the Buddha spent his second week at Uruvelā (i.e. Bodh Gaya) gazing at the Bodhi Tree out of gratitude for the shelter it had offered him <span class='ref'>Ja.i.77</span>. The same text says that as the Buddha sat meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, <em>aṅkura</em> the colour of red coral sprinkled down on him as if they were an offering <span class='ref'>Ja.i.75</span>. <em>Aṅkura</em> usually means a shoot but here it must refer to the glossy crimson sheathing stipuls that are cast off as the new leaves of Bodhi trees develop.</p><p>In the early centuries of Buddhism, the <em>assattha</em> tree became a symbol of the Buddha and in the sculptures of both Bharhut and Sanchi he is depicted as such. In the <em>Mahāvastu</em>, he is actually given the epitaph “Great Tree” (<em>Mahādruma</em>, <span class='ref'>Mv.ii.280</span>). A branch of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka by the nun Saṅghamittā, the daughter of King Asoka, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE and is believed to still grow in Anurādhapura. A distant ancestor of the original Bodhi Tree grows behind the Mahābodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya.</p></dd></dl>"

The first is black with a grey neck, mantle and breast while the second is a glossy black all over. Both are alert, aggressive and daring birds that do not hesitate to attack animals much larger than themselves either to rob them or to protect their young. The Buddha said that crows are truculent and pushy, greedy and gluttonous, cruel and pitiless, rough and harsh-voiced, muddle-headed and given to hoarding things <span class='ref'>A.v.149</span>.

A profusion of red or orange flowers appear after the leaves fall. The pods are velvety-brown, about 15 centimeters long and contain flat oval-shaped seeds. When flowering a blood-red juice issues from the trunk and branches and hardens into an astringent gum which has medicinal uses. Lac insects are often cultivated on this tree.</p><p>Once, a monk asked several of his fellows how insight is attained and each gave him a different answer. Confused, he went and told the Buddha what the other monks had said and the Buddha replied. “Suppose a man who had never seen a <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree went and asked another man what such a tree looked like.

The <em>Arthaṣāstra</em> gives this recipe for <em>āsava</em> - 10 <em>palas</em> of <em>kapitha</em> pulp, 500 <em>palas</em> of sugar cane juice and 1 <em>prastha</em> of honey.</p><p><em>Jologi</em> was the juice of the <em><a href='/define/khajjūra'>khajjūra</a></em> or the wild date palm and the <em>t</em><em>āla</em> either brewed or distilled. Whether <em>jologi</em> could be drunk by monks and nuns even before it had been fermented, was one of the points discussed during the Second Council <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.294</span>. This debate probably concerned the fact that before palmyra or wild date juice is properly brewed, it spontaneously ferments within a few hours of being tapped, producing approximately 3% alcohol. Other types of alcoholic beverages were <em>kapotika</em><span class='ref'>Vin.iv.109</span>, <em>madhu</em><span class='ref'>S.i.212</span> and <em>varuni</em><span class='ref'>A.iii.213</span>.</p><p>The Jātaka tells a legendary but plausible story of how alcohol was discovered. Long ago in a certain forest there was a fruit tree which had a large forked trunk with a depression in it. Rain water collected in the depression, fruit fell into it and warmed by the sun it fermented. In the summer, thirsty birds drank from the depression, became intoxicated, fell to the ground and after sleeping for a while, flew away. A hunter observed this and curious as to its cause, he too drank some of the liquid and became intoxicated. Later, he introduced this drink to his friends and so it was that alcohol became known. According to the Jātaka, this discovery opened the way for innumerable social ills <span class='ref'>Ja.v.12-20</span>. Concerning the consumption of alcohol, the Buddha said: “Whoever follows the Dhamma should not drink or encourage others to do so, knowing that intoxication is the result. Because of intoxication the fool commits evil deeds and makes others negligent too. So avoid this root of wrong, this folly loved only by fools” <span class='ref'>Sn.398-9</span>.

The Buddha said that when he was a prince he used only sandalwood from Vārānasi <span class='ref'>A.i.145</span>. Powered sandalwood (<em>candanacuṇṇa</em>) was sometimes rubbed dry on the body or burned as an incense, and it is said that sandalwood powder fell from the sky just before the Buddha’s final Nirvāna at Kusinārā <span class='ref'>D.ii.137</span>.</p><p>The early Buddhists frequently equated sandalwood with things thought of as virtuous or holy. “Just as a man who came across a piece of yellow or red sandalwood and he smelled it at the root, in the middle or at the top he would experience a beautiful, sweet and pleasant fragrance, even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts one experiences elation and joy” <span class='ref'>A.iii.237</span>. The <em>Milindapañha</em> compared Nirvāna to the precious and rare red sandalwood. “As red sandalwood is hard to obtain, even so, Nirvāna is hard to obtain. Again, red sandalwood is unequalled for its lovely fragrance,even so is Nirvāna unequalled for its lovely fragrance.Yet again, red sandalwood is praised by good people; even so is Nirvāna praised by the Noble Ones.

Here is found the white sandalwood tree and the <em>candaneva</em> tree. These two are much alike and the latter can only be distinguished by going in the height of summer to the top of some hill and then looking at a great distance great serpents may be seen entwining it; thus it is known. Its wood is naturally cold and therefore serpents twine round it. After having noted the tree, they shoot an arrow into it to mark it. In the winter after the snakes have gone, the tree is cut down.” Similar stories about where sandlewood grows and the serpants or dragons that live around it are to be found in Sanskrit works such as the <em>Amarakośa</em> and the <em>Kāvyamīmāṃsā</em>.</p></dd><dt>Medical uses for <td><em>Candana</em></td></dt><dd class='uses'><p>Bark: With root bark of<em>Solanum torvum</em> and <em>Achyranthes aspera</em> for malaria.

Rice was the main food crop in northern India during the Buddha’s time. There are thought to be as many as 200,000 varieties of rice in India today. The <em>Śhunya Purāṇa</em> mentions 50 varieties while the Tipiṭaka mentions about nine, although only one of them can be identified with those known today. <em><a href='/define/Daddula'>Daddula</a></em> was an inferior type <span class='ref'>A.i.241</span> <span class='ref'>D.i.5</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.78</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.156</span> while <em><a href='/define/nīvāra'>nīvāra</a></em> was, according to Pāṇinī, a low quality wild rice <span class='ref'>D.i.166</span>. <em><a href='/define/Pavīhi'>Pavīhi</a></em> <span class='ref'>J.v.405</span> and <em><a href='/define/vīhi'>vīhi</a></em> <span class='ref'>Th.381</span> were common varieties while <em><a href='/define/sāli'>sāli</a></em> was considered the best type <span class='ref'>A.i.8</span> <span class='ref'>A.i.32</span> <span class='ref'>A.i.145</span> <span class='ref'>A.iii.49</span> <span class='ref'>A.iv.231</span> <span class='ref'>D.i.105</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.327</span> This last type was probably an earlier variety of the famous <em>mahāsāli</em> often praised in ancient sources. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang was given this rice when he was in India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century. He wrote: “This rice is as large as a black bean and when cooked is aromatic and shining, like no other type of rice. It grows in Magadha and nowhere else.” According to Pāṇinī, <em><a href='/define/sāli'>sāli</a></em> was grown in the winter and <em><a href='/define/vīhi'>vīhi</a></em> in the summer. The whiter the grains of <em><a href='/define/sāli'>sāli</a></em>, the finer it was considered to be <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.516</span>. The rich ate <em><a href='/define/sāli'>sāli</a></em> and meat but fed their slaves and servants broken rice and sour gruel <span class='ref'>A.i.145</span>. <em><a href='/define/Sāliyavaka'>Sāliyavaka</a></em> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.172</span> was, according to both Pāṇinī and the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>, the name of a variety of rice. Wild or self-cultivated rice, <em>sayañjātasāli</em>, is also sometimes mentioned <span class='ref'>Ja.i.325</span>. One wild variety was called <em><a href='/define/sūkarasāli'>sūkarasāli</a></em>, pig’s rice <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.531</span>. Being the main staple in northern India, the Tipiṭaka contains much information about the cultivation of rice. Paddy fields were square or rectangular and had embankments around them <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.167</span> <span class='ref'>Vin.i.391</span>. A good paddy field had to be level, have deep fertile soil, a reliable water supply, an inlet and outlet for the water and sturdy embankments around it <span class='ref'>A.iv.237</span>. There is mention of ponds or lakes, either natural or man-made, being near paddy fields or of them being situated near rivers <span class='ref'>A.iii.26</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.293</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.167</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.v.35</span>, and we read of hollow tree trunks being used as irrigation pipes <span class='ref'>A.iv.170</span>. Farmers would indicate which fields were theirs with marker stones <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.281</span>. To get a good yield the seed had to be unbroken, capable of sprouting and then well-watered <span class='ref'>A.i.135</span>. It was believed that rice seeds would absorb the essence of the earth and water and that this would determine its taste <span class='ref'>A.v.212</span>. Few of the implements used in agriculture, including rice cultivation, are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka, amongst them the plough (<em>naṅgola</em>) with its iron-tipped plough share (<em>phālapācana</em>), the hoe or spade (<em>kuḍḍāla</em>), the sickle (<em>tiṇalāyana asi</em>) and a tool sometimes translated as a weeding hook (<em>niddāna</em>, <span class='ref'>A.i.204</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.v.45</span> <span class='ref'>Sn.77-8</span>). A ceremony called <em>vappamaṅgala</em> was conducted just before the first plowing in the belief that it would guarantee a good harvest <span class='ref'>Ja.i.57</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.167</span>.</p><p>The growing rice had to be protected from cattle straying into it and from wild birds and animals eating it. The ripening crop was sometimes attacked by a disease called <em><a href='/define/setaṭṭhika'>setaṭṭhika</a></em> <span class='ref'>A.iv.278</span>. The process of harvesting consisted of reaping the rice, gathering it up, tying it into sheaves to dry, treading it out, winnowing it and then threshing it <span class='ref'>A.i.241</span>. The grains were loosened from the stalks by driving cattle over it <span class='ref'>Th.1</span> or by beating it out with flails <span class='ref'>S.iv.201</span>. The winnowing was done by dropping the grain from a height and allowing the wind to separate the grain from the chaff. The harvesters would take care to keep the grain and the chaff separate and use a broom to sweep them apart <span class='ref'>A.iv.169</span>. Alternatively, sometimes winnowing baskets shaped like an elephants” ear were used to fan the grain from the chaff and then to remove grit <span class='ref'>Ud.68</span>. After the harvest the rice was stored in a granary <span class='ref'>Vin.i.240</span> and every now and then it would be taken out to be aired <span class='ref'>Vin.i.211</span>.</p><p> Plain boiled rice was called <em>odana</em> or <em>bhatta</em> and was usually eaten with various curries and condiments <span class='ref'>A.iv.230</span>. The rich would have the blackened grains removed from their rice <span class='ref'>A.iv.230</span> while the poor might be reduced to eating even the scum formed by cooking rice <span class='ref'>A.i.241</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.289</span>. Bran, (<em><a href='/define/kaṇa'>kaṇa</a></em>, <em><a href='/define/kukkusa'>kukkusa</a></em> or <em>kuṇḍaka</em>), the brown covering of grains removed during polishing or milling, was considered the most humble of foods and was made into cakes and gruel <span class='ref'>D.i.166</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.423</span>. People considered milled and polished white rice to be superior to unmilled brown rice. A guest in the Jātaka noticed that at the beginning of his stay his host served him white rice but as time progressed it became brown, indicating that he had outstayed his welcome <span class='ref'>Ja.v.233</span>.</p><p>Rice was sometimes cooked together with sesame seeds <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.425</span>. <em>Kaṇājaka</em> was a porridge made from the broken grains that had been removed while cleaning the rice <span class='ref'>Ja.v.230</span>. A porridge of rice boiled in milk was called <em>khīrodana</em> <span class='ref'>Vv.33.24</span> or <em>pāyāsa</em> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.391</span> <span class='ref'>S.i.166</span>. An idiom said that a loving couple were as inseparable as ghee mixed into <em>pāyāsa</em>, which must have been another way of serving this porridge <span class='ref'>Ja.i.457</span>.A feature of various auspicious occasions was to scatter grains of popped rice (<em>lajja</em>) together with flower petals of different colors <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.240</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.42</span>. A confectionary called <em>madulāja</em> was madeof balls of popped rice held together with molasses<span class='ref'>Ja.iii.539</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.214</span>. A gruel called <em>yāgu</em> <span class='ref'>A.iii.50</span> <span class='ref'>D.i.76</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.247</span> was probably made as it is today by boiling rice in water to a thin consistency and adding salt, a garlic clove and a few pepper corns. The Buddha said there were five benefits of this rice gruel; it dispels hunger, quenches thirst, regulates wind, cleanses the bowels and it helps digest the remnants of food <span class='ref'>A.iii.249</span>. Another type of gruel was called <em>bilanga</em> <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.77</span>. A type of alcoholic beverage was prepared from cooked rice with yeast added <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.109</span>. A preparation called <em>thālīpāka</em> was made, according to the <em>Gūhya Sūtra</em>, of either rice or barley cooked with either milk or water and was used as an offering to the gods. After being offered this food was eaten <span class='ref'>A.i.166</span> <span class='ref'>D.i.97</span> <span class='ref'>S.ii.242</span>.</p><p>The Nidānakathā gives the recipe for a rice dish called <em>gavapāna</em>. To make it, one boiled milk until it thickened, added rice a little at a time, then added a cooked mixture of honey, palm sugar, flour and ghee and then let it simmer until the rice was soft <span class='ref'>Ja.i.33</span>. In several places in the Tipiṭaka women are dismissed as having a “two-fingered wit” <span class='ref'>S.i.129</span>.

They would cut the stalks, grasp them, shake them up and down, throw them aside and then cut more <span class='ref'>S.iii.155</span>. After this the stalks would be tied into sheaves <span class='ref'>S.ii.113</span>. The Buddha said: “By hankering for the future and pining for the past, fools dry up and wither away like a green reed that has been cut” <span class='ref'>S.i.5</span>. Numerous household articles were made out of reeds and rushes; sandals and stools <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.39</span>, baskets and mats <span class='ref'>S.i.5</span>. They were also used to make small huts <span class='ref'>S.i.156</span> <span class='ref'>S.iv.185</span>, to thatch the roofs of houses and in the wattle-and-daub construction of walls <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.318</span>. In the Jātaka, there is a story about merchants who sail to a sea called Nāḷamala which looked like a vast expanse of reeds <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.140</span>.

There are three species of cobra found in northern India. When referring to the cobra the common words for snakes, <em>āsīvisa</em> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.274</span>, <em><a href='/define/sappa'>sappa</a></em> <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.6</span> and <em>nāga</em> <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.166</span> are used together with the comment that it has a hood, suggesting that the cobra was also known as “the hooded snake”. Snake charmers were a feature of street life in cities and towns <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.198</span> and they usually used cobras because of their impressive appearance, their ability to stand erect and their tendency to follow and therefore appear to dance to the moving flute played by the charmer. These charmers were believed to use special herbs and magic spells to mesmerize cobras in order to attract and then catch them. They would approach the snake, seize it by the tail, drag it backwards so that it would be stretched out full length and then use what was called a “goat’s foot stick” to pin its head down. Seizing it by the head and applying pressure to the sides would force the cobra’s mouth open so the charmer could spit the juice of certain herbs into it which would, it was believed, break its fangs. Over the next few days the cobra would be subjected to a series of procedures meant to pacify it and get it used to being handled. These procedures were called <em>cuṇṇamāna</em>, <em>tantamajjita</em> and <em>dussapoṭhima</em> and seem to have involved wrapping the cobra in cloth and then stretching, squeezing, massaging and striking it. After this the cobra was ready to be used <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.457</span>. During their performances, charmers would make cobras dance and drape them around their necks <span class='ref'>Ja.i.370</span>. They would feed them with frogs they had killed <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.458</span>. The species of cobra favored by charmers has always been the nocturnal Indian Cobra, <em>Naja naja</em>, because daylight hampers its ability to strike.

The banyan is famous for growing up against other trees and eventually strangling them. The Jātaka described a bird eating banyan figs, later dropping its excrement in the fork of a flame of the forest tree where the banyan seeds germinated, put forth red shoots and foliage and eventually strangled the tree <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.208</span>. The Buddha said that craving is like the trunk of the banyan that clings to and eventually envelops the things it comes into contact with <span class='ref'>S.i.207</span>.

A popular place near Kapilavatthu, the Buddha’s hometown, was the Banyan Park, perhaps named after a large banyan tree that grew there <span class='ref'>A.v.82</span>. People would make vows before banyan trees, offering them flowers and perfume, watering them and reverently walking around them <span class='ref'>Ja.i.259</span> and hence their alternative name “Vow Tree” (<em><a href='/define/vararukkha'>vararukkha</a></em>, <span class='ref'>Ja.i.259</span>). One of the 32 characteristics of the Mahāpurisa’s body is that it has the proportions of a banyan tree, i.e. the length of his arm is equal to his height <span class='ref'>D.ii.18</span>. The previous Buddha Kassapa was enlightened under a banyan tree <span class='ref'>D.ii.4</span>.

However, birds in general are frequently referred to. In the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> birds are classified as either peckers, scratchers, aquatic or birds of prey, although no attempt is made in the Tipiṭaka to classify them. Birds leave no track as they fly through the sky <span class='ref'>Dhp.92</span>. They flock to big banyan trees to roost, eat the fruit and rest in the shade <span class='ref'>A.iii.42</span> <span class='ref'>A.iii.304</span>.

The call of some birds sounded to the Indian ear like words, a point made by the grammarian Yāska. The <em>jīvaṃjīvaka’s</em> cry sounded like “Live!” (<em>Jīva</em>) and another bird seemed to say “lift up your hearts”(<em>utthehi citte</em>, <span class='ref'>D.iii.201</span>). The monk Rāmaṇeyyaka said that the chirping and twittering of the birds in the forest did not disturb his meditation <span class='ref'>Th.49</span>. Whether in the forest or at the edge of the village, the bird songs always gave delight. The Jātaka says: “Around and about the trees can be heard the chorus of flocks of <em><a href='/define/najjuhā'>najjuhā</a></em> birds and cuckoos as they fly from one tree to another.

The lotus is a perennial aquatic herb with large, round pastel-green leaves which sometimes float on the surface of the water or rise above it and with prickly stems <span class='ref'>Sn.845</span>. Lotus blossoms can be pink or white and were named <em>kokāsaka</em> or <em>kumuda</em> <span class='ref'>Dhp.285</span> <span class='ref'>D.ii.179</span> and <em>kokanada</em> or <em><a href='/define/puṇḍarīka'>puṇḍarīka</a></em> <span class='ref'>A.iii.239</span> <span class='ref'>S.i.81</span> respectively. Five hues of white were also discerned <span class='ref'>Ja.i.281</span>. It seems that the word <em>paduma</em> was sometimes used loosely enough to include the Blue Water Lily, <em>Nymphea caerulra</em>. This is clear from the fact that the Buddha mentions <em>paduma</em> as being white, pink or blue <span class='ref'>A.i.145</span>. As there is no blue lotus this must refer to the blue water lily, more commonly called <em><a href='/define/uppala'>uppala</a></em> in Pāḷi.</p><p>Lotuses grew in the wild but were also planted in bathing tanks and garden ponds for beautification. When in Campa, the Buddha would stay at one such tank, Gaggarā’s Lotus Lake <span class='ref'>D.i.111</span>. Such ponds, whether natural or man-made are described as being full of cool, sweet and clear water and lotus blossoms of different colors <span class='ref'>S.i.138</span> <span class='ref'>Vin.i.5</span>. When still a bodhisattva, the Buddha had three palaces, each with a pond of blue water lilies and pink and white lotuses <span class='ref'>A.i.145</span>. The lotus has a sweet subtle perfume although it is hard to say whether this comes from the petals, the stem or the pistils <span class='ref'>S.iii.130</span>. In one delightful story, a monk who waded into a lotus pool to bathe and smell the flowers was chided by a god for being a “smell thief” <span class='ref'>S.i.204</span>. Comely young men or women were described as having “an excellent lotus-like beauty” <span class='ref'>A.iii.90</span> <span class='ref'>A.iii.152</span> and a sincere and generous layman was described as “the lotus of laity” <span class='ref'>A.iii.206</span>. People would make garlands out of lotus blossoms and also eat the stems and roots <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.308</span> and a drink was made from the juice extracted from the root <span class='ref'>Vin.i.246</span>. Moggallāna is described as collecting lotus roots and stalks to make them into a medicine for fever <span class='ref'>Vin.i.215</span>. Lotus nectar was also drunk <span class='ref'>Ja.v.466</span> and the leaves were used to make holders and to wrap food in <span class='ref'>S.v.438</span>.</p><p>There are several things about the lotus that seem to have fascinated the Buddha and were often mentioned by him. The first was that such a beautiful pure flower emerges from dirty muddy water. To him, this was analogous to the enlightened person’s transcendence of <em>saṃsāra</em>. “Just as the lotus is born in the water and grows up beneath the water, yet remains undefiled by the water, fragrant and beautiful. Just so, the Buddha is born in the world, grows up and dwells in the world but like the lotus unstained by the water, he is not defiled by the world” <span class='ref'>A.iii.346</span> <span class='ref'>S.iii.140</span> <span class='ref'>Sn.71</span> <span class='ref'>Th.700-1</span>. The second thing was the fact that water will not adhere to the lotus leaf. Because of microscopic waxy papillae on the surface of the leaf water splashed on it turns into quicksilver-like drops and immediately slips off, leaving no trace of moisture. “Whoever in the world overcomes this low unruly craving, sorrow falls away like drops of water on a lotus leaf” <span class='ref'>Dhp.336</span> <span class='ref'>Dhp.401</span>.

Trees are perennial erect plants usually with a single woody stem from which branches bearing leaves extend. The Jātaka says: “It is called a tree because it has branches. Without branches it’s just a stake”<span class='ref'>Ja.iv.483</span>. The Tipiṭaka mentions many types of trees, and trees in general. Some of the structural components and other parts of trees referred to include the roots (<em>mūla</em>), the trunk (<em>daṇḍa</em> or <em>khandha</em>), the periderm or outer bark (<em>papaṭikā</em>), the phloem or inner bark (<em>taca</em>), the sapwood (<em>pheggu</em>), the heartwood (<em><a href='/define/sāra'>sāra</a></em>), branches (<em>sākhā</em>), twigs (<em>pasākhā</em>), leaves (<em>paṇṇa</em> or <em><a href='/define/paṭṭa'>paṭṭa</a></em>) and crown (<em>agga</em>, <span class='ref'>M.i.193-196</span>).</p><p>Roots, those parts of trees and other plants that anchor them and absorb and transport water and nutrients, are discussed in detail in the Tipiṭaka. Some of the different root systems mentioned include large woody roots (<em>mūla</em>), tap roots and lateral roots (<em>mūlāni ahogamāniyāni</em> <em>tiriyaṅgamāni</em>), feeder roots (<em>nāḷi</em>), spreading roots (<em>mūlasantānaka</em>), hair roots (<em>mattāni</em>, <span class='ref'>S.ii.87-8</span> <span class='ref'>S.iii.155</span>, and in the case of some other plants, tubers (<em><a href='/define/āluka'>āluka</a></em> or <em>āluva</em>, <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.46</span>) and bulbous roots (<em><a href='/define/kanda'>kanda</a></em>, <span class='ref'>D.i.101</span>). The aerial roots of banyan trees were called “trunk-sprung” (<em>khandhaja</em>, <span class='ref'>Sn.272</span>). It was understood that roots absorb moisture and nutrition from the soil and that the sap (<em><a href='/define/ojā'>ojā</a></em>) moves upwards through the trunk into the branches and leaves. The <em>Visuddhimagga</em> says: “When a great tree is growing on the earth, nourished by the essence of humus and, with that as condition, its roots and trunk, branches and shoots, foliage, flowers and fruit grow so it fills the sky and continues the tree’s species until the end of the aeon, one cannot say that the essence of humus is only found in the roots but not in the trunk or in the fruit but not in the roots, and so on. And why? Because it spreads throughout the whole tree from the roots upwards” <span class='ref'>Vism.688</span>. The Buddha said: “Just as a tree that has been cut down can grow again if its root is undamaged and complete, in the same way this suffering returns again and again if the tendency to craving is not removed” <span class='ref'>Dhp.338</span>. However, it was observed that some plants, palm trees in particular, could not grow again if they were “cut off at the root” <span class='ref'>A.i.137</span>.</p><p>There were still large forested tracts in northern India during the Buddha’s time. The Mahāvana or Great Forest, extended almost unbroken from the outskirts of Vesālī to the lower Himalayas. Once, the Buddha stayed in a forest near the village of Pārileyya where an elephant looked after him <span class='ref'>Ud.42</span>. Other forests visited by the Buddha were the Dark Wood near Sāvatthi <span class='ref'>S.i.130</span>, the Forest of Offering at Kusinārā <span class='ref'>A.v.78</span> the Gosiṅga Forest at Vesālī where many sal trees grew <span class='ref'>A.v.134</span> and the Cool Forest to the west of Rājagaha near the city’s charnel ground <span class='ref'>A.iii.373</span>. Very large and majestic trees were sometimes called <em>vanaspati</em>, “forest lords” <span class='ref'>S.iv.302</span> <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.47</span>.</p><p>The Buddha encouraged monks and nuns to seek solitary lodgings in the forest <span class='ref'>A.ii.250</span>, “at the roots of trees, mountain slopes, a glen, a hill cave, a cemetery or a woodland grove” <span class='ref'>M.iii.3</span>. He said: “The one who wears rag-robes, who is lean, with protruding veins and who meditates alone in the forest - him I call a true Brahmin” <span class='ref'>Dhp.395</span>. Some monks tried living in hollow trees and in the fork of trees <span class='ref'>Vin.i.152</span>. A forest-dwelling monk was advised not to settle down at the foot of a tree on a border, one used as a shrine, one from which resin or fruit was collected, one in which flying foxes roost, a hollow tree or one growing in a monastery <span class='ref'>Vism.74</span>.</p><p>However, forests could also be frightening places; they were the abode of dangerous animals and bandits and travelers could get lost in them <span class='ref'>A.i.153</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.320</span> <span class='ref'>S.i.181</span> <span class='ref'>S.iii.108</span>. The Buddha commented that when he lived in the forest before his enlightenment sometimes at night “an animal would prowl around, a peacock would snap a twig or the wind would rustle the leaves” and he would be filled with terror <span class='ref'>M.i.210</span>. Those entering the forest had to be careful of what fruit they ate as some were poisonous <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.200</span>. Some forested areas were thorny, unpleasant and difficult to walk through without getting cut or scratched <span class='ref'>S.iv.189</span>.</p><p>Trees, whether wild or cultivated, provided people with many useful products, the main ones being fuel for fire and material for building. People gathered fire wood in forests <span class='ref'>S.i.180</span> and the Jātaka says: “Forests are made of (potential) fire wood” <span class='ref'>Ja.i.289</span>. Once the Buddha met King Pasenadi’s minister of works while he was supervising the cutting of timber in a sal forest <span class='ref'>S.i.179</span>. The Bhaddasāla Jātaka makes the interesting comment that all the royal palaces in India were supported by numerous columns, some of which must have been wooden. It seems that the king of Benares wanted to construct a magnificent palace supported by a single column and commanded his officers to find a tree trunk big enough for the purpose. They went to the forest and located enough such trees but the state of the roads, they reported to the king, would not allow for the transportation of such a huge log <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.153</span>.</p><p>Fences and kraals were made out of the branches of thorn trees <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.154</span>. The leaves of certain trees were used to make various household articles like baskets, fans and plates and were used as wrappers for food <span class='ref'>S.v.438</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.510</span>. Parasols could be made out of leaves <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.79</span>. The seed pods (<em>sipātikā</em>) of some trees contained down (<em><a href='/define/tūla'>tūla</a></em>) which could be used to stuff pillows and pad furniture and saddles.</p><p>Another product of trees that a use was found for was the bark (<em>taca</em>, <em>vāka</em> or <em><a href='/define/vakkala'>vakkala</a></em>, <span class='ref'>A.i.152</span> <span class='ref'>D.i.167</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.13</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.198</span>). Household articles like fans and ropes are occasionally mentioned as being made out of bark <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.204</span> <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.130</span>. Ascetics are often described as being dressed in <em><a href='/define/vakkala'>vakkala</a></em> <span class='ref'>A.i.240</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.274</span>. Although this is usually taken to mean a type of cloth made from bark this may not be the case. More likely it was made out of fibers from the phloem or inner bark of some type of tree or trees. <em><a href='/define/Vakkala'>Vakkala</a></em> clothing made a rustling noise as the wearer moved <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.274</span>. The commentary to the Nidānakathā mentions some of the benefits of this unusual type of clothing. It is cheap, it can be made by oneself, it is hard to get dirty and easy to wash, it is easy to mend, it is not difficult to get a new one when the old one is worn out, it is suitable for the ascetic life, thieves do not bother to steal it, it does not beautify the wearer, it is light to wear, it is conducive to contentment, it can be obtained by righteous means and if it is lost it causes no regret <span class='ref'>Ja.i.9</span>. <em><a href='/define/Vakkala'>Vakkala</a></em> might have also refered to ordinary cotton or hemp cloth colored with a dye made from the bark of the <em><a href='/define/tirīṭa'>tirīṭa</a></em> tree <span class='ref'>D.i.66</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.343</span>. There are occasional references to ascetics wearing wood fibers (<em>darucīraka</em>), which might be an alternitave name for <em><a href='/define/vakkala'>vakkala</a></em> <span class='ref'>Ud.39</span>, or wearing <em><a href='/define/phalaka'>phalaka</a></em>, which may have been wooden slats or even wood shavings <span class='ref'>Vin.i.360</span>. These and similar unusual clothing are described as the “characteristic of ascetics of other sects” and were not allowed to be worn by Buddhist monks <span class='ref'>Vin.i.306</span>.</p><p>The Buddha encouraged the planting of fruit trees along roads to offer both shade and food for travelers <span class='ref'>S.i.33</span>. We read of a man tapping tree trunks with his axe to find hollow ones to use as water pipes <span class='ref'>A.iv.170</span> and another doing so to find hollows where bees might be nesting <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.200</span>. Sometimes as an act of merit, people would repair roads by filling in pot holes, removing large stones and cutting down the trees that might strike the axles of passing chariots and carts <span class='ref'>Ja.i.199</span>. Certain trees were cultivated for their fruit, flowers, foliage and timber. To grow successfully, a sapling had to have its roots cleared of weeds from time to time, be fertilized with humus (<em>paṃsu</em>) and be regularly watered <span class='ref'>S.ii.89</span>. People believed that spirits lived in medical herbs and trees (<em>ārāmadevatā</em>, <em>rukkhadevatā</em>, <em>vanadevatā</em>, <span class='ref'>A.iii.369</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.307</span> <span class='ref'>S.iv.302</span>), particularly very old, gnarled or beautiful ones. These spirits lived in the hollow of trees or in their crowns <span class='ref'>Ja.i.405</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.423</span>. Before cutting a tree, a woodsman would inform the tree spirit of his intentions and make offerings to it <span class='ref'>Ja.i.442</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.114</span>. Other trees were worshipped and given offerings because the spirits were believed to grant wishes. Milk and water were poured on the roots, garlands were hung in the branches, lamps of scented oil were burned around them and cloth was tied around their trunks <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.104</span>. There is the occasional mention of animal and even human sacrifices being made to trees. The victim’s blood was poured around the foot of the tree and the entrails were draped over the branches <span class='ref'>Ja.i.260</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.160</span>. It was believed that trees would give their bounty on condition that they were treated with a degree of respect and the Buddha told a story that illustrates this point. Long ago, the mythical King Koravya had an amazing banyan tree in his realm which bore fruit of exceptional sweetness. Everyone in the realm enjoyed the fruit freely and so there was no reason to guard the tree. But one day a man ate his fill of the fruit then broke a branch and went away. This act of ingratitude so angered the tree spirit that it caused the tree to bear no more fruit <span class='ref'>A.iii.369-70</span>.</p><p>As with other popular beliefs and superstitions the Buddha did not endorse tree worship. He said: “Gripped by fear people go to sacred mountains, groves, parks and trees. But these are not a safe refuge, not the best refuge. By going there one is not freed from all suffering” <span class='ref'><span class='ref'>Dhp.188</span>-9</span>. However, the Buddha did respect the beliefs of others and when a certain monk cut down a tree worshipped by local people to make way for a monastery he severly rebuked him for doing so <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.156</span>.</p><p> Some of the most beautiful passages in Buddhist literature relate to trees. The Buddha said of a kindly hospitable person that he was “like a great banyan tree growing on the side of roads that welcomes weary travelers with its cool shade and soothes their tiredness” <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.526</span>. The general Buddhist attitude of respect for trees is expressed in these words from the Petavatthu: “Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a branch of it should he break, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer...Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a leaf should he injure, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer” <span class='ref'>Pv.21.3</span> <span class='ref'>Pv.21.5</span>. The <em>Milindapañha</em> says that the diligent disciple should try to be like a tree. “As a tree makes no distinction in the shade it gives, like this, the meditator should make no distinction between any beings, but develop love equally to thieves, murderers, enemies and to himself” <span class='ref'>Mil.410</span>. The <em>Buddhacarita</em> compares spiritual practice to a tree “the fibers of which are patience, the flowers virtue, the boughs awareness and wisdom, which is rooted in resolution and which bears the fruit of Dhamma”<span class='ref'>Bc.13.65</span>. The <em>Mahāvastu</em> says: “The meritorious person grows like a banyan tree, while the person of little merit becomes stunted like a tree planted in the roadway” <span class='ref'>Mv.ii.423</span>. In his <em>Bodhicariyāvatāra</em>, the poet Śāntideva wrote of his longing for the peace of the forest life in these words: “The trees do not speak harsh words nor do they try to please by artifice. When shall I have the opportunity to dwell with those happy to live with the trees?”<span class='ref'>Bcv.viii.26</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

Quails could be seen running amongst the clods after the fields had been ploughed <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.59</span> <span class='ref'>S.v.146</span>. They were hunted with nets <span class='ref'>Ja.i.208</span> and taken home to be fattened up before being eaten <span class='ref'>Ja.i.434</span>. Male quails are very pugnacious and setting them to fight each other was a popular entertainment <span class='ref'>D.i.6</span>. The Buddha said that too much or too little exertion could be detrimental to concentration, just as holding a quail too tightly would kill it or holding it too loosely would allow it to fly through one’s fingers <span class='ref'>M.iii.159</span>. Once, when the arrogant young brahmin Ambaṭṭha was visiting the Sākyans, he got the distinct impression that they were whispering about and laughing at him. Later he complained of this to the Buddha who defended his kinsmen by saying: “But Ambaṭṭha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes in her own nest” <span class='ref'>D.i.91</span>. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as an elephant and became leader of a large herd. A quail made her nest in the elephant’s feeding ground and the Bodhisattva stood over it to prevent it being trampled by the other elephants <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.174</span>. Again according to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a quail <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.59</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

Over 30 varieties grow in northern India. Bamboo is an economically important plant, its strong but light and flexible wood being used for a wide variety of purposes. Washing was hung on bamboo poles and needle cases were made out of bamboo tubes. It was also plated and woven into baskets <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.5</span> and grown in lines to form hedges <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.154</span>. Bamboo very rarely flowers, but when it does it dies <span class='ref'>Ja.v.71</span> <span class='ref'>S.ii.241</span>. Its spreading fronds get tangled up with each other <span class='ref'>Sn.38</span> and young bamboo shoots are already hard and difficult to tread down <span class='ref'>Th.72</span>. Workers in bamboo were considered low caste <span class='ref'>A.ii.85</span> <span class='ref'>A.iii.385</span>.</p><p>One of the Buddha’s favorite resorts in Rājagaha was the Bamboo Grove, a park offered to him by King Bimbisāra <span class='ref'>Vin.iv.39</span>. To this day dense thickets of the Thorny Bamboo, <em>Bambusa arundinacea</em>, grow around Rajgir, modern Rājagaha, and may be the type that was familiar to the Buddha. The ancient Buddhists believed that having the flexibility of bamboo would be a virtue. The Jātaka commented that to live successfully in the royal court it is wise to “bend like bamboo”<span class='ref'>Ja.vi.295</span>. Nāgasena said: “Bamboo does not bend any which way, but the way the wind blows. Likewise the monk, having followed the nine parts of the Buddha’s, the Lord’s teachings and being established in that which is good and blameless, should go the way of true asceticism” <span class='ref'>Mil.ii.372</span>. The popular trick where a man holds a bamboo pole erect and a child ascends it and balances on the top, was sometimes preformed as an entertainment <span class='ref'>S.v.168</span>. A segment of bamboo, called a <em>nāḷi</em>, was used as a measure of capacity <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.67</span> <span class='ref'>Vin.i.249</span>.

Being thus banished, they settled at the foot of the Himalayan foothills beside a lotus pond where there was a <em>sāka</em> forest. Not wanting to degrade their lineage, they cohabited with their own sisters. King Okkāka asked his ministers and advisers: ‘Where are they living now?’ and when they told him he said: ‘They are strong as <em>sākas</em>, they are real Sākyans! ’ and this is how the Sākyans got their well-known name” <span class='ref'>D.i.92</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

The sal and its flower are often referred to in the Tipiṭaka <span class='ref'>Th.948</span>. It has dark green leaves, a straight trunk and is beautiful to see <span class='ref'>Ja.v.251</span>. The huge sal trees that grew in the lower reaches of the Himalayas are described as having leaves and foliage, bark and shoots, soft wood and heart wood <span class='ref'>D.iii.152</span>.</p><p>The Tipiṭaka describes how a man would make a boat out of a sal trunk. First he would locate a large tree in the forest and cut it down with his ax. After shaping the exterior and hollowing out the inside, he would then further shape it with a scraper and then smooth it with a rock ball. Finally, he would fix a rudder, make a pair of oars and then slide it down to the river <span class='ref'>A.ii.201</span>. The Buddha describes a man going to a sal forest near a village and cutting down the other trees and the crooked sal saplings so that the already well-established sal trees would grow bigger and straighter <span class='ref'>M.i.125</span>. Sal trees were sometimes strangled by parasitic vines <span class='ref'>Dhp.162</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.v.452</span>.</p><p>The Rukkhadhamma Jātaka uses the thickness of a sal forest to illustrate the advantages of unity. King Vessavaṇa asked all the tree spirits to select for themselves a plant as their home. The Bodhisattva, who had been reborn as a tree spirit, advised his kinsmen to avoid trees that stood alone and pick those that grew close to others. Some did as he advised, making their homes in a thick sal forest, but others moved into isolated trees growing near towns and villages thinking that they would receive offerings humans made to such trees. One day a mighty storm swept over the country uprooting even the mightiest and most deeply rooted trees growing in the open. But the sal trees in the forest, supported by each other and with their branches interlaced withstood the storm <span class='ref'>Ja.i.328-9</span>.</p><p>When the Buddha arrived in Kusinārā on his last tour and lay down between two sal trees, they burst into flower out of season and sprinkled their petals over him. When Ānanda expressed amazement that the very trees were revering him, the Buddha said: “Ānanda, these sal trees burst into flower out of season in homage to the Tathāgata and covered his body - but the monk or the nun, the lay man or the lay woman who lives practicing the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfills the Dhamma, they honors, reveres and respects the Tathāgata with the highest homage” <span class='ref'>D.ii.137-8</span>. In the light of this story and the traditional belief that the Buddha passed away during Vesākha, it is interesting to note that the sal usually blossoms in March-April and occasionally in May. The Buddha once said that his Dhamma was so convincing that if the great sal trees had consciousness and could comprehend, even they would benefit from it <span class='ref'>A.ii.193</span>.</p><p>One moonlit night, Ānanda and Revata went to visit Sāriputta at the sal forest of Gosinga which was “delightful - with all the trees in full bloom and with a heavenly fragrance wafting through the air” <span class='ref'>M.i.212</span>. Sometimes gruel was made from or flavored with sal flowers or perhaps its resin <span class='ref'>A.iii.49</span>. The sal was and continues to be even today an important source of timber in India. Oil distilled from the seeds is used for lamps and the resin which exudes naturally or is sometimes tapped is used as a medicine, to make incense and also a perfume called <em>dammar</em> in Hindi. Sal butter, which is extracted from the seeds, is used as substitute for cocoa in the manufacture of chocolate.

Eventually she came to the Buddha who gently told her to get a white mustard seed from a house in which no one had ever died. Thinking that this seed would miraculously revive her child she went from house to house asking for one.

The Asiatic lion is a large stately tawny-colored cat with a long tail with a tuft at the end. It differs slightly from its African cousin, being smaller and having a fringe of hair down its abdomen and in the males a less luxuriant mane. The lion’s preferred habitat is dry jungle and open grassland where they hunt deer and sometimes domestic cattle.</p><p>The Buddha said that of all animals the lion is the best in respect to strength, speed and courage <span class='ref'>S.v.227</span>. They were said to be “five-pawed”(<em>pañcahattha</em>), the mouth being the fifth “paw” <span class='ref'>Ja.v.425</span>. Being a noble creature, they always lie on their right sides, with one paw on the other and with their tails between their thighs <span class='ref'>A.ii.245</span>. The male lion emerges from its lair in the evening, stretches, looks around, roars three times and then goes in search of prey <span class='ref'>A.ii.32</span>.When other animals hear the lion’s roar they are frightened. “Those who live in burrows descend into them, aquatic animals take to the water, forest dwellers make for the forest and birds take to the air” <span class='ref'>A.ii.33</span>. When the lion strikes at its prey, whether it be an elephant, buffalo, ox, leopard, hare or cat, it does so with great skill <span class='ref'>A.iii.121</span>.</p><p>In one place we read of monks finding and eating the remains of a lion’s prey <span class='ref'>Vin.iii.57</span> and of monks being attacked and killed by lions. Lions are often accompanied by jackals. A preparation called lion oil was considered very valuable, but it is uncertain whether it was given this name because of its supposed potency or because it was actually made from lion tallow <span class='ref'>Ja.i.98</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.v.149</span>.

The Buddha himself said: “Lion, monks, is a name for the Tathāgata, the Arahat, the Fully Enlightened one” <span class='ref'>A.iii.121</span>. When he lay down to rest or to sleep, the Buddha always did so in the “lion posture”, i.e. on his right side, with one foot on the other, mindful and fully aware <span class='ref'>S.i.27</span> <span class='ref'>S.i.106</span>. His bold and confident claim to be enlightened was called his “lion’s roar” <span class='ref'>A.ii.10</span>. Two of the 32 special characteristics of the Mahāpurisa are that the front of his body is like that of the lion and his jaw like a lion’s <span class='ref'>D.ii.18</span>.

Syrian rue is found in the western and central part of the Ganges valley and grows best in semi-barren areas.</p><p>According to the Jātaka, in two of his former lives the Bodhisattva became so fond of pressing and drinking <em>soma</em> and of offering it to the gods that he came to be known as Sutasoma <span class='ref'>Ja.v.177</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.v.457</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

About the size of the domestic goose, this beautiful bird has gray, brown and white plumage with a white head and neck marked by two distinctive black bands. The bird’s gentle musical “<em>aang aang aang</em>” call is often praised in ancient Indian literature. The famous ornithologist Salim Ali describes it as “one of the most unforgettable and exhilarating sounds” to be heard in nature. Vaṅgīsa addressed the Buddha saying: “Quickly send forth your melodious voice, oh Beautiful One. Like geese stretching out their necks, honk gently with your soft well-modulated voice” <span class='ref'>Sn.350</span>. Bar-headed geese are often seen during the winter feeding in swamps and fields, and then in mid-March they fly off to nest in Tibet. To the Buddha this migratory behavior was suggestive of detachment. “Mindful people exert themselves. They are not attached to any home. Like geese that quit their lakes, they leave one abode after another behind” <span class='ref'>Dhp.91</span>. “Geese fly the path to the sun, sages fly by their psychic powers. Having defeated Māra and his army the wise are led away from the world” <span class='ref'>Dhp.175</span>. Piṅgiya used the geese’s arrival back in northern India in October as a metaphor for the coming of something wonderful. “Just as a bird might leave a small wood to dwell in a forest full of fruit, so do I, having left narrow-minded teachers, come to He of Wide Vision, like a goose arriving at a great lake” <span class='ref'>Sn.1134</span>. One of the most beautiful legends in the whole of the Buddhist tradition comes from the Sanskrit <em>Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra</em> and concerns a bar-headed goose. Once, while walking through the palace garden, Prince Siddhattha saw a goose fall from the sky with an arrow lodged in its wing. He gently nestled the bird in his lap, extracted the arrow and anointed the wound with oil and honey. Soon afterwards, Devadatta sent a message to the palace saying that he had shot the bird and demanding that it be returned to him. Siddhattha replied to the message by saying “If the goose was dead I would return it forthwith. But as it is still alive you have no right to it.” Devadatta sent a second message arguing that it was his skill that had downed the goose and as such it belonged to him. Again Siddhattha refused to give his cousin the bird and asked that an assembly of wise men be called to settle the dispute. This was done and after discussing the matter for some time the most senior of the wise men gave his opinion, saying “The living belongs to he who cherishes and preserves life, not to he who tries to destroy life”. The assembly agreed with this and Prince Siddhattha was allowed to keep the goose.</p><p>According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as a bar-headed goose <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.208</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.246</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.423</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

A male in must was <em>pabhinna</em> <span class='ref'>Dhp.324</span>. Females were called <em>uccākaṇerukā</em> <span class='ref'>M.i.178</span> or <em>kareṇukā</em> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.343</span> and a female with protruding tusks was called <em>kaḷārikā</em> <span class='ref'>M.i.178</span>. An elephant that had reached 60 years old was called <em>saṭṭhihāyana</em> <span class='ref'>M.i.229</span> and calves were known as <em>hatthikalabha</em>, <em>kaṇeru</em> or <em>susanāga</em> <span class='ref'>A.iv.435</span> <span class='ref'>D.ii.254</span>. Elephants with pink spotted foreheads, a sign of age, were called <em>padumin</em> <span class='ref'>D.i.75</span> <span class='ref'>M.iii.93</span>. Several other types of elephants are mentioned, such as the <em>vāmanakikā</em> but it is not clear what distinguished them from others <span class='ref'>Ja.v.416</span> <span class='ref'>M.i.178</span>. The Pāḷi, Bengali and Hindi word <em>hatthī</em> means “one with a hand” and refers to the dexterous way elephants use their trunks.</p><p>Slightly smaller than its African cousin, the Asian elephant has grey wrinkled skin, a long trunk, a two-domed head and drooping ears. They can grow up to 3 meters at the shoulders and weigh as much as 5,000 kilograms. Asian elephants prefer thick or light jungle and eat the leaves, bark and fruit of trees, grass and aquatic vegetation. They will also raid fields and orchards. In his famous parable of the blind men and the elephant the Buddha described the elephant’s ears as being like a winnowing basket, its tusks (<em>danta</em> or <em>hatthidanta</em>) like plough poles, the body like a granary, the legs like pillars, the tail is like a pestle and the tuft of the tail like a broom <span class='ref'>Ud.68-9</span>. The frontal lobes of the elephant’s head were called “pots” (<em>kumbha</em>) and the trusks, the small tusks on females, were known as <em>kaḷārikā</em> <span class='ref'>M.178</span>. Temporin, the odorous tar-like secretion that oozes from the males during must, was called <em>kaṭuka</em> <span class='ref'>Dhp.324</span>. The ancient Indians revered the elephant for its strength, nobility and intelligence and elephants are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka more than any other animal. Elephants lived in certain forests <span class='ref'>M.iii.132</span>, probably because they offered better shelter, food and water than other places. Males were believed to avoid the cows and their calves so that they would not be bothered by them or have to eat the leaves and grass that they had already cropped or drink the water they had muddied <span class='ref'>A.iv.435</span>. It was noticed that elephants have very particular behavior; when they charge they spread their ears and make their tails erect <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.194</span>, they sniff the dung of other elephants <span class='ref'>A.iii.157</span> and they dislike heat <span class='ref'>D.ii.266</span>. Males regularly go into must when temporin flows from their ears <span class='ref'>Dhp.324</span> and they become aggressive and unruly so that their mahouts have to hold them in check <span class='ref'>Dhp.326</span>. At such times they may kill people or even knock down dwellings <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.494</span>. Elephants enjoy swimming and they amuse themselves by squirting water into their ears and over their backs <span class='ref'>A.v.201</span>. They pull up lotus stalks, wash them to get the mud off and then eat them <span class='ref'>S.ii.269</span>. A bull elephant might be seven or eight cubits high <span class='ref'>A.v.201</span> and some could live for 60 years or more <span class='ref'>M.i.229</span>. Elephants were domesticated in India at least 1,500 years before the Buddha’s time. Trackers skilled in reading the marks left by them - footprints, the scrapings of their tusks on trees, broken foliage, etc - were employed to find the animals <span class='ref'>M.i.178</span>. Domesticated elephants would be used to capture the wild ones <span class='ref'>M.iii.132</span>. Once caught, the trainer had to subdue the creature’s forest habits, memories and behavior, subdue its distress, fret and fever over missing the forest, and get it used to towns and people. The tamer used gentle kind words and the elephant would gradually respond and begin eating again. Then the trainer would teach the elephant commands like “Take up!” “Put down!” “Go forward!” “Go back!” “Get up!” “Sit down!” After that, it would be taught what was called “endurance.” A plank was tied to the elephant’s trunk, a man would sit on its back and then it would be surrounded by other men who would poke it with poles and spears and make a great racket while the trainer would command it not to move <span class='ref'>M.iii.132-33</span>. To mount a trained elephant the mahout would take his hook and say: “Give me your foot” and the elephant would bend its knee so the mahout climbs on its back <span class='ref'>Thi.49</span>. When domesticated elephants heard the roar of the lion they would strain at and break the leather bonds that held them, defecate, panic and run around <span class='ref'>A.ii.32</span>. Because of their value, there were veterinarians specializing in elephant health <span class='ref'>Ja.i.485</span>. Ivory was a much-prized product. Bracelets, boxes for eye-salve, caskets, ornament boxes in fantastic shapes, vases and anklets were made out of it. There is mention of a mirror handle being made out of ivory <span class='ref'>Ja.v.302</span>. There was a bazaar of ivory workers in Vārānasi <span class='ref'>Ja.i.320</span>. A type of curved wall peg was called “elephant tusk” <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.113</span> and one way of wearing the monks” under robe was to role it up at the front rather than fold it, a style known as “the elephant’s trunk” <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.136</span>. The capitals of pillars in buildings were sometimes carved to resemble elephants <span class='ref'>Vin.ii.169</span>. Domesticated elephants were used for work, transportation, in warfare and to enhance royal glory. The elephant brigade was one of the four traditional branches of the army, the others being cavalry, chariots and infantry <span class='ref'>D.i.137</span>. Being crushed by an elephant was a form of capital punishment <span class='ref'>J.i.200</span>. In battle, elephants would take great care to protect their softest and most vulnerable part, their trunk <span class='ref'>M.i.415</span>. A large tusked elephant was an essential possession for a monarch. King Ajātasattu rode his royal tusker from Rājagaha to meet the Buddha at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove <span class='ref'>D.i.49</span>. Once, the Buddha and Ānanda were bathing in the river at Sāvatthī when Seta, King Pasenadi’s elephant, arrived to the accompaniment of music. Soon an admiring crowd had gathered to watch, commenting “What a beauty! What a sight! What a delight for the eye! What a body! Now that really is an elephant!” <span class='ref'>A.iii.345</span>. An elephant fit to be a royal mount in war had to have four qualities. It had to respond well to training. In battle it had to destroy other elephants and their mahouts as well as cavalry, chariots and their drivers and footmen. It was expected to endure the injuries of spears, swords, arrows and axes and the din of drums, conchs and other noises, and it was expected to go in whichever direction the mahout directed it <span class='ref'>A.ii.115</span>.</p><p>One of the skills taught to princes along with horsemanship, archery, swordsmanship and chariot driving, was the art of training, riding and caring for elephants <span class='ref'>A.iii.152</span>. This was called elephant lore <span class='ref'>A.iii.326</span>. During a food shortage the king’s elephant died and people ate it <span class='ref'>Vin.i.218</span>. The rare white elephant was particularly prized <span class='ref'>Ja.i.319</span> and one of the accoutrements of a universal Monarch was a pure white elephant of sevenfold strength <span class='ref'>D.ii.174</span>. The mount of Indra, the king of the gods, was a magnificent elephant named Erāvana <span class='ref'>Sn.379</span> or sometimes Maghavā. <span class='ref'>S.i.229</span>. Some lay people were rich enough to be able to own elephants. When Soṇa became a monk, he said he had renounced everything he owned including “a herd of seven elephants”, the implication being that he had been very wealthy <span class='ref'>Vin.i.184</span>.</p><p>The Buddha seems to have had a special fondness for elephants. The animal’s mindful and deliberate behavior and particularly the male’s penchant for living alone in the jungle, impressed him. “On this matter the enlightened sage and the elephant with tusks as long as plough poles agree, they both love the solitude of the forest” <span class='ref'>Ud.42</span>. In some ways the Buddha even considered elephants to be better than humans. The elephant trainer Pessa once said to him: “Humans are a tangle while animals are straightforward. I can drive an elephant undergoing training and in the time it takes to make a trip to and from Campa, that elephant will display every kind of deception, duplicity, trickery and fraud. But our servants, messengers and employees, they say one thing, do another and think something else.” The Buddha agreed with this observation <span class='ref'>M.i.340</span>. He often compared himself to or was compared by others with an elephant <span class='ref'>A.ii.36</span>. When Doṇa encountered him sitting at the foot of a tree, he appeared “beautiful, faith-inspiring, with calm senses and a serene mind, utterly composed and controlled like a tamed, alert, perfectly trained elephant” <span class='ref'>A.ii.36</span>. The Buddha never looked over his shoulder when he wanted to see behind him but turned around completely as does an elephant. This was called his “elephant look” <span class='ref'>D.ii.122</span>.</p><p>Throughout the Tipiṭaka, the Buddha advised his disciples to respond to difficulties as would an elephant. “I shall endure abuse as a bull elephant in battle endures the arrows shot from the bow. For indeed, ill-natured people are many”<span class='ref'>Dhp.320</span>. “Formerly this mind wandered wherever it wished, where it liked and as it pleased. But today I shall completely control it as a mahout controls an elephant in must” <span class='ref'>Dhp.326</span>. “Rejoice in awareness and guard your mind well. Pull yourself out of evil as does an elephant stuck in the mud” <span class='ref'>Dhp.327</span>. “If you do not find a wise, zealous and virtuous companion to wander with, then like a king abandoning his conquered realm, wander alone like a bull elephant in the forest” <span class='ref'>Dhp.329</span>. Elephants are frequently mentioned in the Jātaka where they are usually depicted as noble, kindly and intelligent creatures. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as an elephant <span class='ref'>Ja.i.319</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.444</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.174</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.90</span> and once as a human he worked as an elephant trainer <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.94</span>.</p></dd></dl>"
