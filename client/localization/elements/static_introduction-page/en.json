This is a large collection of teachings attributed to the Buddha or his earliest disciples, who were teaching in India around 2500 years ago.

They teach non-violence and compassion, and emphasize the value of the spiritual over the material. Many discourses discuss meditation, while others are concerned with ethics, or with a rational and clear understanding of the world as perceived. They show the Buddha engaging with people from all walks of life and discussing a diverse range of topics. But he said that all of his words have one taste, the taste of freedom.",

The early texts depict the Buddha in a vivid and diverse range of contexts, speaking with monastics, ascetics, criminals, kings, businessmen, lepers, prostitutes, paupers, wives, skeptics, friends, and enemies. It’s not just what he says, but the way he deals with this spectrum of humanity, always with kindness, clarity, dignity, and respect.",

Sometimes, however, there is a less close relationship between two given texts. In such cases we indicate a “resembling parallel”. This doesn’t imply any particular kind of relationship between the resembling parallel and the basic text.

When does a text stop being a full parallel and start being a resembling parallel? And when does it become merely a text that bears certain similar features? There are no black and white answers to such questions. Rather, making these identifications draws on the accumulated learning and experience of a succession of scholars. Inevitably there will be disagreements in detail; yet in the main, there is a broad consensus as to what constitutes a parallel. Ultimately, the important point is that these identifications help the student to study and learn from related texts in diverse collections.",

For example, the <i>saṁyutta</i> is used in the Saṁyutta Nikāya for groups of discourses on the same topic, and the <i>nipāta</i> is used in the Aṅguttara Nikāya for groups of discourses with the same number of items. In the Vinaya, the <i>khandhaka</i> is likewise an essential structural feature. Elsewhere, however, we find structures of less importance, such as the <i>pannāsa</i> or group of fifty discourses.
