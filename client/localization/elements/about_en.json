  "about:1": "About SuttaCentral",
  "about:2": "SuttaCentral is a project for early Buddhist texts based in Australia. We have no institutional affiliation, but are simply a group of friends interested in the Suttas. The founders were Rod Bucknell, John Kelly, and Bhante Sujato. The project leader is Bhante Sujato. The project is supported entirely by donations. These are managed by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a non-profit charity incorporated in Australia.",
  "about:3": "SuttaCentral helps you to study Buddhist texts from comparative and historical perspectives. It focuses on the early Buddhist texts that stem from the lifetime of the Buddha or a little later. These are preserved in the Pali Sutta and Vinaya Piṭakas as well as in ancient Chinese and Tibetan translations and in fragmentary remains in Sanskrit and other languages.",
  "about:4": "SuttaCentral lets you read Pali, Chinese, Tibetan, and/or Sanskrit discourses in their original languages as well as in modern translations in many languages, and to look up the parallels of any given discourse. ",
  "about:5": "The project is much more than a website, as we support an ongoing effort to create new translations in many languages with our Bilara translation app. Selected translations are also available in book form. SuttaCentral collaborates internationally with scholars in related fields.",
  "about:6": "SuttaCentral is under constant development and updates are made regularly. To keep up with what’s new, <a href='https://discourse.suttacentral.net/c/meta/updates'>check the Updates category in our forum</a>.",
