It’s divided into two books: <cite>Buddhist Life</cite> for the foundational teachings and <cite>Buddhist Path</cite> for systematic training in the higher path leading to awakening. Each book can be studied independently and in either order.",
  "start:14": "<b><a href='https://wisdomexperience.org/product/buddhas-words/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>In the Buddha’s Words</a>:</b> Bhikkhu Bodhi presents selected discourses of the Buddha from the Pali Canon, the earliest record of what the Buddha taught.

  "start:27": "Just jump in",
  "start:28": "Sure, a structured course is a good way to get an overview of the teachings. But life isn’t structured. The Buddha didn’t teach everything from A–Z, he responded to the needs of those he was with. Sometimes the things we learn most from are random; a phrase we happen to overhear, or a word that comes at just the right time.",
  "start:29": "So why not just try a random sutta? Or search to see what the Buddha had to say about cats?",
  "start:30": "Read them all",
  "start:31": "There are a lot of suttas. But not <em>that</em> many. A few years of a regular reading habit and you should be able to read all the suttas in translation. Why not?"
