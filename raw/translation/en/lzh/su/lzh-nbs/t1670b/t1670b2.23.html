<h1>2.23. Interdependence of Name and Form</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked, “You were talking just now of name-and-form, what does name mean, what does form mean?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “What is currently existing is the form (i.e. the body), what the mind thinks is name.”</p>
<p>“Why is it, Nāgasena, that name is not reborn separately from its form?”</p>
<p>“The name and form of a person are connected one with another and spring into being together. It is like an egg that consists of the yoke and the egg-shell. Just so, the name is not separate from its form.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
