<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Is there anyone who, with his physical body, could go to the seventh heaven of Brahman or to Uttarakuru, or any other place as he wishes to go?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Nāgasena.</p>
<p>“Then how <a class="t" id="t718b"></a> could a person with his physical body go to the seventh heaven of Brahman, or to Uttarakuru, or any other place as he wishes to go?”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena asked the king, “Do you remember, great king, that you have ever jumped one zhang in playing when you were small?”</p>
<p>“Yes, when I was young, if I wished to jump, I could jump more than a zhang.”</p>
<p>“In the same way, he who has attained the Path could go to the seventh heaven of Brahman or to Uttarakuru with his physical body if he wishes.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
