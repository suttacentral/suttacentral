<h1>2.45. Existence of the Buddha</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Have you, Nāgasena, seen the Buddha?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “No, I have not.”</p>
<p>“Then have your teachers seen the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“No, my teachers also have not seen the Buddha.”</p>
<p>“Then Nāgasena, since you and your teachers all have not seen the Buddha, there is certainly no Buddha.”</p>
<p>“But great king, have you seen the place where the five hundred waters come joining together?”</p>
<p>“No, I have not seen it.”</p>
<p>“Then have your father and grandfather seen the water?” <a class="t" id="t715b"></a></p>
<p>“No, none of them have seen it.”</p>
<p>“Then, since you, your father and grandfather all have not seen the place where the five hundred waters come joining together, there is certainly no such a place in the world where five hundred waters come joining together.”</p>
<p>“Though, my father, grandfather and I have not seen such waters, there are definitely such waters.”</p>
<p>“Though my teachers and I have not seen the Buddha, definitely the Buddha existed.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
