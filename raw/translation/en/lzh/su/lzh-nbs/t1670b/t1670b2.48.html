<h1>2.48. Rebirth</h1>
</div>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena, “Is the old body not reborn when a person dies?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “When a person dies, he receives a new body, the old body is not reborn.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena gave a simile, “It is just like the interchange of two wicks of a lamp, the old wick still remains, and the new one is lit. It is the same with regard to the body of a person. The old body does not transmigrate, but he receives a new body.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena asked the king, “Have you, great king, learned the ancient scriptures from a teacher when you were a boy?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the king.</p>
<p>“Great king, when you learned the scriptures from your teacher, did your teacher still have the knowledge of these scriptures when he comes across these scriptures?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my teacher still has the knowledge of these scriptures.”</p>
<p>“So is the body of a human being. It gives up the old body and takes the new one.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
