<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“If there is a person who knows <span class="add">how</span> to appreciate, <span class="add">he or she,</span> never being oblivious of small favours, to say nothing of great acts of kindness, deserves honour. Should <span class="add">that person</span> be a thousand or one hundred thousand yojanas away from here, <span class="add">he or she</span> would not after all be far away; <span class="add">that person</span> would, as it were, be close and not estranged from me. For that reason a monk should know that I always admire and praise someone who knows how to appreciate. </p>
<p>“Those who do not know how to appreciate great acts of kindness, let alone small favours, are neither close to me nor I am to them. Even if <span class="add">an ungrateful person</span> formally wears <span class="add">his or her</span> formal robes in my presence, <span class="add">he or she</span> is after all far away. </p>
<p>“For this reason, O monks, you should be mindful of appreciating <span class="add">and you should</span> not imitate <span class="add">others</span> who do not appreciate. Thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
