<h1><span class="add">The Buddhas Make Effort</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks </p>
<p>“There are persons who are lazy, who do not embark on virtuous actions and who in their deeds meet with misfortune; on the other hand, there are those who are capable of not <span class="add">succumbing to</span> laziness, who put effort into <span class="add">what is to be done</span> and who are most accomplished in respect of all that is karmically wholesome so that there is an increase in what is <span class="add">truly</span> advantageous. </p>
<p>“Thus <span class="add">with reference to the latter persons</span> it will take the bodhisattva Maitreya thirty aeons until he becomes a Buddha by realising full and complete enlightenment. All on his own he will make use of the force of effort and utmost determination, so that in future <span class="add">he</span>, Maitreya, will be <span class="add">my successor</span>. </p>
<p>“Also in the past, innumerable beings, like the sands of the <span class="add">River</span> Ganges, <span class="add">became</span> foremost arhats, Fully and Completely Enlightened Ones. All of them succeeded in realising Buddhahood on account of their utmost determination. With the help of this ‘skill in means’ one should know that laziness is conducive to suffering, leads to miserable destinies and in one’s deeds one will meet with misfortune. If <span class="add">on the other hand</span> one is capable of utmost determination and of putting forth effort, all that is karmically wholesome, all virtues <span class="add">will be accomplished</span> so that there will be an increase in what is <span class="add">truly</span> advantageous. </p>
<p>“Therefore, O monks, you should be mindful of putting forth effort and do not be negligent. Thus, monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
