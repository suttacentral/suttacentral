<h1><span class="add">Contentment</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“If a monk who lives in a forest at a secluded, quiet place remote from crowds, he should always reverentially cultivate a mind that is content. If, on the other hand, a monk, living a a forest at a secluded and quiet place, does not reverentially cultivate contentment, he will mainly occupy himself in staying with crowds for the sake of what people talk about <span class="add">because</span> he does not know what a forest-dweller’s practice should be like. </p>
<p>“How then has a monk, <span class="add">although</span> fond of solitude, no reverential attitude and does not cultivate contentment? The answer is <span class="add">this</span>, O monks: first the <i>āraṇyaka</i> monks, staying at a secluded, quiet place and avoiding the crowds, continually puts effort into <span class="add">what is to be done</span> and does not <span class="add">succumb to</span> laziness and arrogance; first he is well aware of the necessity of what <span class="add">he should</span> practice. If, in the course of his forest-dwelling and abiding at a secluded, quiet place, he becomes lazy and arrogant, he will involve himself in all <span class="add">sorts of</span> misconduct, staying with big crowds for the sake of what people talk about. Such an <i>āraṇyaka</i> monk is lazy and lacking effort. </p>
<p>“For this reason, monks, a monk who is fond of solitude, living at a secluded, quiet place and avoiding crowds, should always be gentle and cultivate contentment. Being rid of laziness and arrogance, reverentially and mindfully putting effort into <span class="add">what is to be done</span>, with unwavering determination and wholeheartedly taking upon oneself all that is karmically wholesome—thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
