<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s <a class="t" id="t601a"></a> Park. The Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are these two character traits to which one should not be devoted or excessively attached <span class="add">because they lead to</span> man’s misfortune and desertion. Which are the two character traits? </p>
<p>“a) All that can be subsumed under hatred which one should not give oneself over to … <span class="add">leads to</span> man’s misfortune and desertion; </p>
<p>“b) The refusal to help others and lack of courtesy which one should not … <span class="add">lead to</span> man’s misfortune and desertion. </p>
<p>“These are, O monks, the two traits of character which one will not be happy with and to which one should not be devoted.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, monks, there are two character traits which do not <span class="add">lead to</span> man’s misfortune and desertion. Which are the two? </p>
<p>“a) One’s overcoming hatred which <span class="add">makes for</span> man’s complete satisfaction and; </p>
<p>“b) All that can be subsumed under helpfulness and courtesy and which is most appreciable and respectable, <span class="add">making for</span> man’s complete satisfaction. </p>
<p>“These are the two … <span class="add">making for</span> … satisfaction. </p>
<p>“Now on account of what, why have I just mentioned hatred and all that can be subsumed under lack of helpfulness and courtesy on the one hand, and one’s overcoming hatred and all that can be subsumed under lack of helpfulness and courtesy on the other?” </p>
<p>“The Exalted One,” a monk affirmed, “is the chief master of all teachings. Would the Exalted One be kind enough to give us an explanation. Having listened, all monks will be much obliged and respectfully apply themselves to practice.” </p>
<p>“Listen attentively,” responded the Exalted One, “and take heed of what <span class="add">I am going to say</span>. It is appropriate that I throw light on what has been said. </p>
<p>“The <span class="add">above first</span> two character traits, O monks, are due to desire because of which they come into play, arise and effective and manifest themselves. One should train to dispel this desire without letting it arise <span class="add">anew</span>. Thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
