<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are three bad practices. Which are the three? Bad practice of body, speech and mind. These, O monks, are the three bad practices. </p>
<p>“One should aspire to skill in means to cultivate three good practices. Which are the three? Somebody whose practice of body, speech and mind is bad, should cultivate good practice of body, speech and mind.” </p>
<p>Then the Exalted One uttered to following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“One should guard against bad practice of body and <br>
Cultivate good practice of body; it <span class="add">should always</span> be<br>
Kept in mind to give up bad practice of body, and good <br>
Practice of body should be learnt. One should guard<br>
Against bad practice of speech … and mind and <br>
Cultivate good practice of speech … and mind; it<br>
<span class="add">Should always</span> be kept in mind to give a bad practice<br>
Of speech … and mind; and good practice of speech … <br>
And mind should be learnt.<br>
<span class="add">Good</span> practice of body is excellent, and<br>
<span class="add">Good</span> practice of speech likewise, to be sure,<br>
<span class="add">Good</span> practice of mind is excellent; and the same<br>
Holds true of <span class="add">good practice</span> in every respect.<br>
Restraint in speech, purity of mind and no bad practice<br>
Of body—by realising purity in these three practices<br>
One will reach the <span class="add">Great</span> Sage’s state of the Unconditioned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thus, monks, one should give up the three bad practices and cultivate the three good practices, and thus, O monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
