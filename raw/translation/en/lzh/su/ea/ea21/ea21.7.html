<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“There are three <span class="add">kinds of</span> severe affliction. Which are the three? There are the severe afflictions <span class="add">caused by</span> a) the windy humour of the body, b) the phlegmatic humour and c) cold. These are, O monks, the three <span class="add">kinds of</span> severe affliction. </p>
<p>“But there also are available three <span class="add">kinds of</span> effective medicine for the three severe afflictions. Which are the three? When somebody is affected by windy humour of the body, an effective medicine will be ghee; what one does in this case is to take ghee. When somebody is afflicted with the phlegmatic humour, an effective medicine will be honey; what one does … ; and when somebody is afflicted with cold, an effective medicine will be sesame oil; what one does in this case is to take sesame oil. These are, bhikkhus, the three <span class="add">kinds of</span> severe afflictions and their respective cures.</p>
<p>“Similarly, monks, there are the following three <span class="add">kinds of</span> severe affliction. Which are the three? a) Covetousness/attachment, b) hatred/aversion and c) ignorance/delusion; these, monks, are the three <span class="add">kinds of</span> severe affliction. </p>
<p>“But there are also available three <span class="add">kinds of</span> effective medicine for the three severe afflictions. Which are the three? When there is covetousness and attachment, one <span class="add">should</span> have recourse to repulsiveness as a remedy by way of reflecting on what is repulsive. When  one is afflicted with hatred or aversion, one <span class="add">should</span> have recourse to friendliness as a remedy by way of cultivating friendliness as remedy by way of cultivating friendliness in one’s heart. <span class="add">When</span> one is afflicted with ignorance and delusion, one <span class="add">should</span> have recourse to wisdom as a remedy by way of <span class="add">insight into</span> dependent origination. These are, monks, the three <span class="add">kinds of</span> severe afflictions and their respective cures. </p>
<p>“Accordingly, monks, you should aspire to skill in means to avail yourselves of the three <span class="add">kinds of</span> remedy. Thus, monks, you should train.” </p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
