<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. The Exalted One said to the monks: </p>
<p>“There are these three <span class="add">kinds of</span> virtue pertaining to taking refuge of one’s own accord. Which are the three? The first <span class="add">kind of</span> virtue pertains to taking refuge in the Buddha, the second to taking refuge in the Dharma <a class="t" id="t602a"></a> and the third to taking refuge in the monastic Community.</p>
<p>“What does virtue pertaining to taking refuge in the Buddha mean? Among all sentient beings—bipeds, quadrupeds, those with many feet, those with or without form, those with perception or without perception and finally the gods <span class="add">belonging to the sphere of</span> Neither-Perception-Nor-Nonperception—the Tathāgata is superior, he is foremost and without equal. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">Just as</span> from a cow one gets milk, from milk curds <span class="add">one gets butter, from butter one gets</span> ghee and from ghee the skimmings of melted butter, and just as the skimmings of melted butter are superior, foremost and without equal, even so among all sentient beings—bipeds, quadrupeds … and finally the gods <span class="add">belonging to the sphere of</span> Neither-Perception-Nor-Nonperception—the Tathāgata is superior, foremost and without equal. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">When</span> there are sentient beings who have faith in the Buddha, this is called virtue pertaining to faith in what is the best. <span class="add">Those who</span> are possessed of virtue pertaining to <span class="add">faith in</span> what is the best, will have good fortune to be <span class="add">born</span> among gods <span class="add">or</span> as the most splendid among human beings; this is what is called virtue pertaining to <span class="add">faith</span> in what is the best.</p>
<p>“What does taking refuge of one’s own accord in the Dharma mean? As for that which signifies the existential constituents, there are the <i>dharmas</i> under the sway of the malign influences, the <i>dharmas</i> free from malign influences, the conditioned; and the unconditioned <span class="add">being</span> that which is free from greed and undefiled, cessation, <i>Nirvāṇa</i>. It is the <span class="add">unconditioned</span> <i>dharma</i> <i>Nirvāṇa</i> which, among all existential constituents, is superior, foremost and without equal. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">Just as</span> from a cow one gets milk … and just as the skimmings of melted butter are superior, foremost and without equal, even so among the so-called existential constituents—the <i>dharmas</i> under the sway of malign influences and those free from them, the conditioned; and the unconditioned <i>dharmas</i> <span class="add">being</span> that which is free from greed and undefiled, cessation, <i>Nirvāṇa</i>—it is the <i>dharma</i> <i>Nirvāṇa</i> which, among all <i>dharmas</i>, is superior, foremost and without equal. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">When</span> there are sentient beings who have faith in the <i>Dharma</i>, this is called virtue pertaining to faith in what is the best. <span class="add">Those who</span> are possessed of virtue pertaining to <span class="add">faith in</span> what is the best, will have good fortune to be <span class="add">born</span> among gods <span class="add">or</span> as the most splendid human beings; this is what is called virtue pertaining to <span class="add">faith in</span> what is the best.</p>
<p>“What does taking refuge of one’s own accord in the Saṃgha of Noble Ones mean? As for that which is referred to as the Community of Noble Ones, among <span class="add">all</span> forms of monastic communities and <span class="add">all</span> kinds of assemblies in society, the Tathāgata’s Saṃgha is superior, foremost and without equal. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">Just as</span> from a cow one gets milk … and just as the skimmings of melted butter are superior … without equal,—even so as for that which is referred to as the Community of Noble Ones, among <span class="add">all</span> kinds of assemblies in society the Tathāgata’s Saṃgha is … and without equal. </p>
<p>“<span class="add">When there are sentient beings who have faith in the Community of Noble Ones,</span> this is called virtue pertaining to <span class="add">faith in</span> what is the best. <span class="add">Those who</span> are possessed of virtue pertaining to <span class="add">faith in</span> what is the best, will have the good fortune to be <span class="add">born</span> among gods <span class="add">or</span> as the most splendid among human beings, this is what is called virtue … what is the best.”</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The first object of faith is the Buddha, foremost and<br>
Without equal; the second object of faith is the <br>
Dharma which is free from greed and attachment;<br>
Reverence and offerings <span class="add">are due to</span> the saṃgha of<br>
Persons of truth who are the most excellent<br>
Field of merit. Those who know what is<br>
The best, will gain outstanding merit: Having been<br>
<span class="add">Re</span>born as gods <span class="add">or</span> human beings, it will go well for<br>
Them wherever they will be; to them, moreover, will be<br>
Offered the highest seats of honour, and as a matter of<br>
Course, they will partake in ambrosia; they will<br>
Wear garments adorned with the seven kind of jewels,<br>
Being respected by everyone. <span class="add">Those who know what is<br>
the best</span>, will be most conscientious in their moral<br>
Training; they will not be wanting in any of the spiritual <br>
Faculties and will realise an ocean of insight-knowledge<br>
And wisdom. In due course they will reach the sphere of<br>
Nirvāṇa. <span class="add">Whoever</span> takes this threefold refuge will <br>
Make good progress on his <span class="add">or her</span> way without difficulty.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
