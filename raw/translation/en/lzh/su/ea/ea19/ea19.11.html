<h1><span class="add">Āmrapālī</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was wandering through the border area of Magadha and in due course arrived at the City of Vaiśālī. With a great number of monks, altogether five hundred persons, <span class="add">he</span> put up at Āmrapālī’s Park north of Vaiśālī. </p>
<p>Having heard that the Exalted One had come and was staying at her park together with five hundred monks, a woman, Āmrapālī <span class="add">by name</span>, had a carriage made ready <span class="add">which was decorated with</span> precious wings, and mounted it. She drove from Vaiśālī City to the access to a hidden track and then made her way to the Exalted One’s whereabouts. She alighted from the carriage and went on foot to where the Exalted One was. </p>
<p>When he saw a woman at a distance come, he said to the monks, “Everybody should absolutely be on his guard lest wrong thoughts arise in him.” </p>
<p>On her arrival at the place where the Exalted One was, the woman bowed down her head <span class="add">at the Buddha’s</span> feet and sat down to one side. Now the Exalted One expounded <span class="add">to her</span> the most excellent Teaching. Thereafter the woman said to the Buddha, “May the Exalted One, together with the order of monks, kindly accept my invitation <span class="add">to tomorrow’s meal</span>.</p>
<p>The Exalted One consented by silence, and the woman, understanding that by his silence he had accepted her invitation, rose from her seat, bowed her head at <span class="add">his</span> feet and left.</p>
<p>By that time <span class="add">all</span> male and female <span class="add">inhabitants of</span> Vaiśālī, great and small, had heard that the Exalted One was staying at Āmrapālī’s Park with a great number of monks, altogether five hundred persons. In the city there were five hundred youths; they mounted various kinds of carriages <span class="add">decorated with</span> precious wings. Some of them mounted white carriages <span class="add">drawn by</span> white horses; their clothes, parasols, banners and streamers, retinue—all were in white. Others mounted red … blue … yellow carriages <span class="add">drawn by</span> yellow horses; their clothes, parasols, banners and streamers, retinue—all were in yellow. They looked majestic and extraordinarily smart, behaving like kings.</p>
<p>They left Vaiśālī City and drove towards the place where the Exalted One was. While they had not yet reached the <span class="add">main</span> road, they met that woman, moving <span class="add">with</span> speed and whipping her draught-animals galloping towards the centre of the city.</p>
<p>“You are a woman that should be ashamed of herself,” the youths <span class="add">shouted</span> and wanted to know why she was whipping her draught-animals, steering her carriage with great speed towards the centre of the city.</p>
<p>“My dear friends,” the woman informed <span class="add">them after bringing her carriage to a halt</span>, “I would have you know that I have invited the Buddha and his order of monks to tomorrow<span class="add">’s meal</span>. It is for just this reason that <span class="add">I</span> am driving my carriage <span class="add">at speed</span>.”</p>
<p>To this the youths replied, “We would also like to <span class="add">treat</span> the Buddha and his order of monks to a meal. Now <span class="add">we</span> offer you one thousand ounces of pure gold for giving us the exclusive right to <span class="add">treat them</span> to a meal tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking, sons of a great clan,” the woman said, “I do not comply.”</p>
<p>The youths went on offering her two, three, four, five—up to one hundred thousand ounces of gold, <span class="add">asking her whether she would</span> agree or not to give them the right <span class="add">to treat</span> the Buddha and his order of monks to the next day’s meal. The woman, <span class="add">however,</span> insisted, “I do not comply because the Exalted One has repeatedly spoken of two kinds of longing which man cannot give up. Which are the two? The longing for benefit and the longing for long life. Who could guarantee my still being <span class="add">alive</span> tomorrow? So I have invited the Tathāgata first, and now I have got to make all the preparations.”</p>
<p>All the youths shook their fists, <span class="add">saying</span>, “Very much so is our standing of men, and <span class="add">we</span> are not like a woman.” Having had their say, all of them turned round and drove away.</p>
<p>The youths proceeded to where the Exalted One was. They bowed down their heads … stood to one side. When the Exalted One had seen the youths come, he said to the monks, “O monks, look at the majestic appearance of and the gorgeous dress of <span class="add">these</span> youths; they look exactly like Śakra being on tour.”</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One said to the youths, “There are two kinds of essential dispositions which are virtually non-existent in the world. Which are the two? (1) The habit of a person never to neglect rendering <span class="add">others</span> a small service, (2) let alone a great one. These are the two kinds of essential dispositions, young men, which are practically non-existent. You should know, repeatedly bring back into your minds, recognise and <span class="add">finally</span> overcome being careless about rendering <span class="add">others</span> a small service, let alone a great one.”</p>
<p>After <span class="add">this exhortation</span> the Exalted One uttered the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“He who knows how to render <span class="add">others</span> a service<br>
And realises <span class="add">that this should be done</span> repeatedly,<br>
Being always mindful and communicating <span class="add">this<br>
Knowledge</span> to people, will be endowed with<br>
Insight-knowledge, himself being revered and followed,<br>
<span class="add">Whose</span> name will be known to gods and men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thus, young men,<span class="add">"the Buddha went on, “</span> one should know and train.”</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One expounded to all the youths the subtle Teaching. After listening, they rose from their seats, bowed down … and left. </p>
<p>Meanwhile during the night, the woman had many sorts of choice food an delicacies prepared and all the seats arranged. Very early in the morning almost at dawn, <span class="add">Āmrapālī thought to herself</span>, “Now it is going on for the proper time; if only the Exalted One would care to call in at my humble home.”</p>
<p>In time, the Exalted One put on his <span class="add">outer</span> robes and took up his alms-bowl. Leading the monks accompanying <span class="add">him</span> in order of seniority, he entered the city of Vaiśālī and went to the woman’s house. Having seen that the Exalted One had taken his seat, the woman served the meal to the Buddha and then to his order of monks with her own hand. When the Buddha and the order of monks had eaten and fresh water had been passed around, a small seat, inlaid with gold, was brought and placed in front of the Buddha. </p>
<p>Then the woman said to the Exalted One, “Herewith <span class="add">I</span> should like to offer this park of Āmrapālī to the Tathāgata and his order of monks. May, as in the past and at present, also in future many <span class="add">members of</span> the order be lodged in it. May the Exalted One kindly accept this park.” </p>
<p>At the instance of that woman the Exalted One accepted it and then uttered these verses of laudatory blessing:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The effect of <span class="add">this donation of</span> a park is<br>
That <span class="add">prerequisites for</span> the refreshing coolness <span class="add">of nirvāṇa</span><br>
Are given; <span class="add">the park is like</span> a bridge <span class="add">helping</span> people<br>
To cross over <span class="add">to ultimate freedom</span>. <span class="add">If they appreciate<br>
This bridge</span> as a short cut, making <span class="add">use of the analogy<br>
Between the malign influences and</span> a privy, then<br>
Take a rest <span class="add">from them and finally</span>, day and night,<br>
Realise <span class="add">ultimate</span> peace—such happiness is<br>
Beyond imagination. <span class="add">He who</span> lives in accordance with<br>
The teachings and rules of moral training will <br>
After death certainly be born in a heavenly world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Exalted One had uttered these words, he rose and left. After listening to the Buddha’s words, the woman was pleased with herself and respectfully applied herself to practice.</p>
