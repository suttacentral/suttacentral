<h1><span class="add">Mahāprajāpatī and Non-discrimination</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> At one time the Buddha was staying, together with a large <span class="add">number of</span> bhikṣus, viz. five hundred persons altogether, among the Śākyans at Kapilavastu, in the Nyagrodha Park.</p>
<p>Then Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī went to the Exalted One. She bowed her head at his feet and said to him: “<span class="add">I</span> hope for a long time the Exalted One will bring the ignorant and deluded to their senses, and may <span class="add">his</span> life never be endangered!”</p>
<p>“Gautamī”, responded the Exalted One, “such words in regard to the Tathāgata are not appropriate. The Tathāgata <span class="add">can</span> prolong his life-span which will not be short, and his life will never be <span class="add">really</span> in danger.”</p>
<p>Now Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī improvised the following verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“How <span class="add">can one</span> revere him who is foremost, <br>
who is unparalleled in the world? <br>
<span class="add">He</span> is capable of removing all doubts—<br>
That is why these words <span class="add">of veneration</span> are uttered.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Exalted One in turn responded to Gautamī with these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Reverence for the Tathāgata implies <br>
this effort and steadfastness.<br>
A mind that is ever more courageous <br>
and which looks upon Disciples as equals (<i lang="pi">tulya</i>).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to the Exalted One Mahāprajāpatī declared: “Hence-forth the Exalted One should be revered <span class="add">for his</span> the Tathāgata’s, insisting on regarding all living beings with a mind free from <span class="add">the discriminatory concepts of</span> upper and lower (<i lang="pi">adhika-nyūna</i>) <span class="add">classes</span>. Among the heavenly beings, men … and Asuras, the Tathāgata is supreme.”</p>
<p>The Exalted One acknowledged what Mahāprajāpatī had said, and <span class="add">she</span> rose from her seat, bowed down… and left.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said to the bhikṣus: “Among my disciples it is Mahāprajāpatī who is foremost in respect of broad-mindedness and extensive awareness.”</p>
<p>Having heard the Buddha’s words, the bhikṣus were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
