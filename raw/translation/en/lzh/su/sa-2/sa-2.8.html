<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the renunciant Visākha, son of Pañcāla, had assembled a number of monks in the <i>Dhamma</i> hall and preached the <i>Dhamma</i> for them. His words were perfect and what he said was flawless. He was able to delight and comfort his audience, letting them listen without getting bored, and understand his meaning right away. The monks, on hearing him, were so happy they could hardly sit still; they listened whole-heartedly, reverently, with undivided attention they listened to him teaching the <i>Dhamma</i>. <span class="add">He spoke</span> not in order to gain offerings or fame. His arguments were compelling and far-reaching, and he caused his listeners to remember well what he had said.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time a great number of people heard him teaching in this way. A number of monks went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. They told the Buddha: “World-honored One! The monk Visākha, son of Pañcāla, preaches to a large number of people in the <i>Dhamma</i> hall, not in order to gain offerings nor to acquire fame. His arguments are compelling and far-reaching. He is able to make his listeners remember what he says and not forget it.” The Buddha told the monks: “Go and and call this Visākha, son of Pañcāla.” Having received the order, the monks went to summon Visākha. When he received the summons, he went to the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. The Buddha asked Visākha: “Is it true that you assemble the monks and preach <i>Dhamma</i> to them and that they listen whole-heartedly? Is this a fact?” Visākha answered: “It is true.” Then the Buddha praised him: “Very good, very good, Visākha. You assembled the monks in the <i>Dhamma</i> hall, preached the <i>Dhamma</i> for them, and not in order to gain offerings or fame. Your words were perfect, the listeners delighted and you reached their hearts. From now on keep on teaching the <i>Dhamma</i> in this way, generously for <span class="add">their</span> benefit. And you, monks, no matter if many of you <span class="add">are gathered in one place</span> or only a few, you should practise two things: First, you should talk about the principles of <i>Dhamma</i>. Second, if you have nothing to say <span class="add">about the <i>Dhamma</i></span>, be silent. Do not discuss all kinds of secular topics. Now, do not make light of this silence; silence has great benefits.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Gathered in a crowd /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the foolish and the wise are mixed together.<br>
If nothing is said /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the difference between them cannot be known.<br>
If something is said /<br><span class="indent">​</span>then the difference can be told.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>This is why you now /<br><span class="indent">​</span>should talk about the principles of the Dhamma;<br>
let the flame of the Dhamma burn brightly /<br><span class="indent">​</span>hoist the banner of the sage:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>all Arahats /<br><span class="indent">​</span>take the wondrous Dhamma as their banner<br>
all sages /<br><span class="indent">​</span>take well-spoken speech as their banner.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
