<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying <span class="add">north of</span> Rājagaha in the Sītavana forest. At that time the Buddha told the monks: “All compounded things are impermanent. Relentlessly, they quickly pass away. We cannot rely on them as they are bound to decay. You should make haste and leave the realms <span class="add">of <i>saṃsāric</i> existence</span> to follow the path of liberation.” At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: “The renunciant Gotama is expounding such a <i>Dhamma</i> for his disciples in the Sītavana forest at Rājagaha. I should go there and disturb them.” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man, went to the Buddha, stood to one side and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Night and day are eternal /<br><span class="indent">​</span>lives will forever come and go,<br>
turning like a wheel on its axle /<br><span class="indent">​</span>spinning around endlessly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>The Buddha knew King Māra had come to disturb them and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“One’s life—its days and nights do end /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and life itself is filled with sorrows and troubles:<br>
it is like, having fallen into a river, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>being quickly carried away without a trace.<br>
This is why you, Bad One, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>should not disturb us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>There Māra thought: “The Buddha knows my intentions.” And he became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. He made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
