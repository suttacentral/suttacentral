<h1>Uruvela Kassapa performs miracles</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was wandering in Magadha accompanied by a thousand monks who had formerly been virtuous elders among the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s, but who had attained Arahatship, stopped all defilements, ended all bonds of becoming <span class="add">that lead to rebirth</span>, done what was to be done, cast off the heavy burden, reaped their reward. The <i>Tathāgata</i> went to the Suppatiṭṭha <i>deva</i>-shrine in the Laṭṭhivana forest.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>When king Bimbisāra heard that the Buddha was staying in the Laṭṭhivana he immediately set out with 18,000 cavalry, 12,000 palanquins and chariots, surrounded on all sides by a huge number of <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s and lay-men. When he arrived, he left the elephants, horses and chariots behind and took off his jewelry. On approaching the Buddha, he knelt and holding his hands with palms together <span class="add">in salutation</span> addressed the Buddha: “World-honored One! I am Bimbisāra, king of Magadha!” Three times he said this. The Buddha replied: “Very well, Bimbisāra, king of Magadha.” Bimbisāra paid homage to the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side and the <i>brāhmaṇa</i>s and elders of Magadha <span class="add">too</span> paid homage to the Buddha’s feet and one by one came before him and sat down. Sitting down, some raised their hands <span class="add">in greeting</span>, some sat down in silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>At that time Uruvela Kassapa was present and the people of Magadha began wondering: “Is the Buddha the teacher here, or Uruvela Kassapa?” The Buddha knew what the people of Magadha were thinking deep inside and he asked Kassapa with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“At Uruvela you /<br><span class="indent">​</span>for a long time practiced the fire sacrifice;<br>
for what reason now /<br><span class="indent">​</span>have you ceased, given up this practice?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Uruvela Kassapa answered with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“I once practiced fire sacrifice /<br><span class="indent">​</span>desiring a taste of beauty<br>
and the objects of the five sensual pleasures. /<br><span class="indent">​</span>However these are all impure,<br>
therefore I have given up /<br><span class="indent">​</span>fire sacrifices, the way of offerings to fire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“We know you do not find happiness /<br><span class="indent">​</span>in the five sensual pleasures, <span class="add">their</span> form and taste;<br>
what you do treasure now /<br><span class="indent">​</span>make it known to men and gods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>And the venerable Uruvela Kassapa spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Once I was ignorant /<br><span class="indent">​</span>did not know the most true Dhamma,<br>
made fire offerings, practiced asceticism /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and held this to be the cause of liberation.<br>
I was like someone born blind /<br><span class="indent">​</span>not seeing the path to liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>Now I have met the great dragon among men /<br><span class="indent">​</span>who has taught me the correct view of the Dhamma.<br>
Now I have started to perceive /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the traces of the truly Unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>For the benefit of all /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to train us and lead us to liberation<br>
the Buddha has appeared in the world /<br><span class="indent">​</span>teaching the absolute truth,<br>
he leads sentient beings of every kind /<br><span class="indent">​</span>so they may all perceive the light of wisdom.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Buddha spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Now you have well arrived /<br><span class="indent">​</span>have obtained what you longed for,<br>
you have the power of good thought /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and can discern the supreme Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Now you should consider /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the minds of these people here<br>
and display some miracles /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to engender deep respect in them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>At this the venerable Uruvela Kassapa at once entered concentration and using his magical powers, rose up into the air, <span class="add">in various postures</span> sitting, then lying, then walking about. Appearing in the east, walking, standing, sitting, lying, in all four postures, he let water rush out of his upper body and fire from his lower body; <span class="add">then</span> he let water rush out from his lower body and fire from his upper body, <span class="add">then</span> he entered the fire-blaze <i>samādhi</i> and emitted rays in various colors. Having displayed his magical powers in the east, he did the same in the south, the west and the north. When he was finished, he went before the Buddha, paid homage at his feet and said holding his hands with palms together <span class="add">in salutation</span>: “The great sage, the World-honored One is my teacher, from now on I am a student of the Buddha.” The Buddha said: “Very well, you shall learn from me, be my student.” And he ordered him: “Return to your seat now.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>At that time King Bimbisāra of Magadha, having heard what the Buddha had said, was happy and remembered it well.</p>
