<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha stayed in a mango grove in the country of Mithilā.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At this time the Venerable Sujāta had just gone forth and shaved off his hair and beard. He came to the Buddha, paid homage by touching the Buddha’s feet and sat down to one side. The Buddha told the other monks: “This son of a good family, Sujāta, is splendid in two ways: First, his appearance is of extraordinary beauty, his features exceptionally handsome. Second, he was able to shave off his hair and beard and clothe his body with the Dharma robe. Feeling deeply that family life was all too ephemeral, he went forth and pursued the way. He ended all afflictions, is filled with purity, has liberated his mind <span class="add">from desire</span>, has attained liberation <span class="add">from ignorance</span> by wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>In this very body he has attained the unconditioned, forever ended <span class="add">the cycle of</span> life and death. Established in the pure life, he will not have to endure another existence.”</p>
<p>Having said this, the Buddha spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“The monk, always calm and concentrated /<br><span class="indent">​</span>cuts off desire and abandons life and death;<br>
he abides in his final body /<br><span class="indent">​</span>he can defeat Māra’s armies,<br>
training his mind, he breaks all fetters /<br><span class="indent">​</span>his uprightness is without equal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>When the Buddha had finished this discourse, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
