<h1>Sakka pays obeisance to the Buddha 2 (Dhamma)</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “A long time ago Sakka Devānaṃ Inda wanted to go for a ride and enjoy his parkland. He ordered his charioteer Mātali: “Harness the thousand-horse chariot!” Soon Mātali harnessed the chariot, went to Sakka, and said to him: “The chariot is ready. We may leave whenever you please.” Thereupon Sakka left the Vejayanta Palace and with palms together paid obeisance facing south. When Mātali saw this, his mind was filled with surprise and fear, and he dropped the whip and reins.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Sakka said: “What have you seen that you are so scared?” Mātali said: “Maghavā! Husband of Sujā! When I saw you with palms together paying obeisance facing south, my mind became filled with fear and I dropped the whip and reins. All beings revere you; all the kings are under your rule. The four <span class="add">heavenly</span> kings and the thirty-three gods all respectfully revere you. Who then surpasses you in power, that you stand and pay obeisance with palms together facing south?” Sakka answered: “I am revered by everyone, this may be as you say. <span class="add">However,</span> all gods and human beings respectfully venerate the <i>Dhamma</i>. I respectfully pay obeisance to the perfect Discipline and <i>Dhamma.</i>” And Sakka spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Those who have left home /<br><span class="indent">​</span>practice relentlessly,<br>
enter silent meditation for a long time, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>lead the holy life perfectly,<br>
abandon the three poisons /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and can attain the <i>Dhamma</i> of liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>To this <i>Dhamma</i> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I now pay obeisance.<br>
To all great <i>Arahant</i>s /<br><span class="indent">​</span>who have abandoned desire<br>
dispelled the darkness of ignorance, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and cut off all fetters,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>as well as to those lay-people who practice good conduct, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and abstain from evil,<br>
to all followers of the true <i>Dhamma</i> /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I now pay obeisance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mātali said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“You venerate the very best /<br><span class="indent">​</span>I wish to follow you in paying respect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>When Sakka had spoken thus, he paid obeisance with palms together, mounted the chariot and departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka is powerful among men and gods. If even he pays obeisance to the <i>Dhamma</i>, how much more should you, monks, who have shaved off your hair and beard, left home to train in the path, how much more diligent should you be in paying obeisance to the <i>Dhamma</i>!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
