<h1>Māra disturbs the Buddha’s rest</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda. At that time the World-honored One <span class="add">had been practicing while</span> sitting, lying and walking, since the end of the first watch of the night. At dawn he washed his feet, entered his abode, and lay down on his right side, one leg resting on the other. He focused his mind on clarity and, practicing mindfulness, directed his thoughts towards rising <span class="add">after the rest</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>There King Māra the Bad had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama is in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalanda. He <span class="add">had been practicing while</span> walking, sitting and lying down. At dawn he washed his feet, entered his abode, and lay down on his right side, one leg resting on the other. He focused his mind on clarity and, practicing mindfulness, directed his thoughts towards rising <span class="add">after the rest</span>. I should now go and disturb him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Having thought thus he transformed himself into a young man, stood in front of the Buddha and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Why are you sleeping? /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Why are you sleeping?<br>
Is falling asleep /<br><span class="indent">​</span> ‘entering <i>Nirvāṇa</i>?’<br>
Is this ‘ <span class="add">having</span> done what had to be done?’ /<br><span class="indent">​</span>And falling quietly asleep,<br>
even with the sun rising /<br><span class="indent">​</span>you go back to sleep.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>The Buddha knew that Deva Māra had come to disturb him and he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“All living beings are caught in the web of desire /<br><span class="indent">​</span>which pervades everywhere.<br>
I now have torn it apart /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the desires are forever ended.<br><span class="add">When</span> all things arisen have ended /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">I</span> calmly abide in <i>nirvāṇic</i> joy.<br>
You Bad One /<br><span class="indent">​</span>what can you do to me?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>When King Māra heard this verse he became depressed and dispirited. He made himself invisible, left and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
