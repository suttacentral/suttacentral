<h1>Māra disturbs the Buddha’s rest</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Park. During the first watch of the night, the Buddha <span class="add">practiced while</span> sitting in meditation and <span class="add">while</span> walking. When the first watch ended, he washed his feet and entered his abode, lay down on his right side, one leg resting on the other and, focusing his mind on clarity, directed his thoughts towards rising <span class="add">again after the rest</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>King Māra the Bad, understanding the Buddha’s mind, had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama is in Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Park. During the first watch of the night, he <span class="add">practiced while</span> sitting in meditation and walking. When the middle watch of the night began, he washed his feet, entered his abode, and lay down on his right side, one leg resting on the other and, focusing his mind on clarity, he directed his thoughts towards rising <span class="add">again after the rest</span>. I should now go and disturb him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Thereupon, King Māra transformed himself into a young man, <span class="add">stood</span> in front of the <i>Tathāgata</i> and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Do you have nothing else to do /<br><span class="indent">​</span>that you take a nap,<br>
peacefully slumbering, not waking up? /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Passed out as if drunk,<br>
a person without wealth and property /<br><span class="indent">​</span>how can he sleep untroubled?<br><span class="add">Only</span> those with great wealth and property /<br><span class="indent">​</span>pleased and happy fall asleep.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Then the World-honored One knew that Māra had come to disturb him and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“I sleep, not because I lack things to do /<br><span class="indent">​</span>neither am I drunk.<br>
It is because I have no worldly wealth /<br><span class="indent">​</span>that I can sleep now.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>It is because I have gained great<i>Dhamma</i> wealth /<br><span class="indent">​</span>that I can sleep peacefully.<br>
In my sleep /<br><span class="indent">​</span>in every breathing in and breathing out<br>
there is benefit /<br><span class="indent">​</span>nothing is lost.<br>
Awake, there are no doubtful thoughts; /<br><span class="indent">​</span>there is nothing to fear in slumber.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>There are those that have troubles as if a poisoned arrow /<br><span class="indent">​</span>has pierced their heart,<br>
afflicted with many sufferings and pains. /<br><span class="indent">​</span>If even those can sleep,<br>
Why should I who have pulled out the poisoned arrow /<br><span class="indent">​</span>not find sleep?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>On hearing this, Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my mind,” and sad and dejected he returned to his palace.</p>
