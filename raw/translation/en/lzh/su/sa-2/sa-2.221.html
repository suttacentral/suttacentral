<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time there was a nun named Cālā. One morning she took her robes and her begging bowl, and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, and gathered her seat <span class="add">for meditation</span>. She went to the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding, and sat upright under a tree to meditate. At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. There is the nun Cālā who in the morning took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat and has gone into the Andhavana forest for the day’s abiding. <span class="add">Now</span> she is sitting under a tree. I shall go there and disturb her!” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man, approached her, and said: “My lady, where do you desire to be reborn?” The nun replied: “As things stand, I will not be reborn anywhere.” At that time the young man spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Once born we are bound to experience joy /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and the five sensual pleasures.<br>
Who has taught you /<br><span class="indent">​</span>to say you have no need of further birth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nun Cālā replied with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Whoever is born must die /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and is held in bondage by all kinds of suffering.<br>
To cut off all suffering /<br><span class="indent">​</span>is not to ask for further life.<br>
The venerable sage, the seer /<br><span class="indent">​</span>has explained this truth:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Suffering, the cause for its arising, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>all this is to be left behind<br>
through practicing the eight-fold noble path, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>peacefully we move toward <i>Nirvāṇa</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>The World-honored One has taught me, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and I rejoice in his teaching.<br>
I have witnessed and realized this teaching /<br><span class="indent">​</span>and therefore have no joy in birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>I have cut off all craving, /<br><span class="indent">​</span>the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation, /<br><span class="indent">​</span><span class="add">I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br><span class="indent">​</span>Bad One, you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>At that time King Māra thought: “This nun knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
