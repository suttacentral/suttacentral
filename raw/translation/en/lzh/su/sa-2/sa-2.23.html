<h1>Māra disturbs a teaching on impermanence</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying <span class="add">north of</span> Rājagaha in the Sītavana forest. At that time the Buddha told the monks: “Human life is short, it is bound to end. You should make an effort to follow the path and practice in purity and celibacy. Therefore do not be lazy; practice right conduct. You should train yourselves in the <span class="add">right</span> meaning of the <i>Dhamma</i> and true conduct.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: “The renunciant Gotama is expounding the principles of the <i>Dhamma</i> for his disciples in the Sītavana forest at Rājagaha. I should go there and disturb them.” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man and went to the Buddha. He paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. Then he spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Human life is long /<br><span class="indent">​</span>without any cares or worries.<br><span class="add">For those</span> always at ease /<br><span class="indent">​</span>there is no path for death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>The Buddha thought: “Māra the Bad has come to confuse and disturb us.” And he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Human life hurries quickly away /<br><span class="indent">​</span>filled with confusion and trouble;<br>
make haste to practice the good /<br><span class="indent">​</span>as if your head were on fire,<br>
and know the Bad One /<br><span class="indent">​</span>has come to disturb.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Then King Māra, having heard the verse, thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my intentions.” And he became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. He made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
