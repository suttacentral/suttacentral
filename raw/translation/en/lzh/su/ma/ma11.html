<p>Section 2: Related to Deeds</p>
<h1>The Rock Salt Parable</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">I have heard thus:</span> Once, the Buddha travelled to Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time, the World Honored One addressed the bhikṣus: “It is according to the deeds that a person does that he receives his rewards. Thus, one who does not practice the divine practice will not attain the end of distress. Suppose this is said: ‘It is according to the deeds that a person does that he receives his rewards.’ Thus, this one practices the divine practice that leads to the end of distress.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m1"><span class="add">1. Virtue As Water, Evil as Salt</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And why is that? Suppose there is a person who does a deed that is not good and surely will receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this is a person who has not cultivated himself, not cultivated the precepts, not cultivated his mind, and not cultivated wisdom. His life span is very short. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“It is just as when a person tosses a couple salt-rocks into a little water, wanting to make the water so salty as to be undrinkable. What do you think? Can those salt-rocks make the water so salty as to be undrinkable?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>They (the bhikṣus) answered: “So it is, World Honored One. And why is that? The salt-rocks are much while the water is little. This is why they can make the water so salty as to be undrinkable.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“So it is that the person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this is a person who has not cultivated himself, not cultivated the precepts, not cultivated his mind, and not cultivated wisdom. His life span is very short. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Furthermore, there is<a class="t" id="433b"></a> a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present? It means that this is a person who has cultivate himself, cultivated the precepts, cultivated his mind, and cultivated wisdom. His life span is quite long. This is called a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“It is just as when a person tosses a couple salt-rocks into the waters of the Gaṇga, wanting to make the water so salty as to be undrinkable. What do you think? Can those salt-rocks make the waters of the Gaṇga so salty as to be undrinkable?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>They answered: “No, World Honored One. And why is that? The waters of the Gaṇga are a great deal, while a couple salt-rocks are little. This is why they cannot make it so salty as to be undrinkable.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“So it is that the person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present? It means that this is a person who has cultivated himself, cultivated the precepts, cultivated his mind, and cultivated wisdom. His life span is quite long. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m2"><span class="add">2. Virtue as Power, Evil as Injustice</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Furthermore, there is a person who does a deed that is not good and surely will receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this is a person who has not cultivated himself, not cultivated the precepts, not cultivated his mind, and not cultivated wisdom. His life span is very short. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“It is just as when there is a person who takes away another’s sheep. How is it like a person who takes away another’s sheep? It means that the sheep-taker is either a king or a king’s minister who has that majestic power and that the owner of the sheep is poor and powerless. Because he is powerless, he attempts in various ways to show respect, even folding his hands, seeking to inquire, saying: ‘Sir, can you possible see returning the sheep?’ if he sees them and they meet. This is the meaning of it being like a person who takes another’s sheep.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“So it is that the person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this is a person who has not cultivated himself, not cultivated the precepts, not cultivated his mind, and not cultivated wisdom. His life span is very short. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell.</p>

This is called a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>“It is just as when there is<a class="t" id="433c"></a> a person who takes another’s sheep, but the owner returns and takes them back. How is it like a person who takes another’s sheep, but the owner returns and takes them back? It means that the sheep-thief was poor and without strength while the sheep owner was a king or king’s minister with that majestic power. Because he had this power, he could arrest and jail the thief, taking back his sheep. This is the meaning of a person who takes another’s sheep, but the owner returns and takes them back.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>“So it is that the person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present? It means that this is a person who has cultivated himself, cultivated the precepts, cultivated his mind, and cultivated wisdom. His life span is quite long. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc" id="m3"><span class="add">3. Virtue as Wealth, Evil as Indebtedness</span></a></h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>“Furthermore, there is a person who does a deed that is not good and surely will receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this is a person who has not cultivated himself, not cultivated the precepts, not cultivating his mind, and not cultivated wisdom. His life span is very short. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>“It is just as when there is a person who owes five coins to another and the owner jails him; and even if it were just one coin, he still would be jailed by that owner. How is it like a person who owes five coins to another and the owner jails him; and even if it were just one coin, he would still would be jailed by that owner? It means that the person who owes it is poor and powerless. Because he is powerless and owes five coins to another, he was jailed by the owner; and even if it were just one coin, he still would be jailed by that owner. This is the meaning of a person who owes five coins to another and the owner jails him; and even if it were just one coin, he still would be jailed by that owner.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>“So it is that the person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell. How is it that this person who does a deed that is not good will surely receive a distressful result, the reward of Hell?

This is called a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>“It is just as when there is a person who owes a hundred coins but who is not jailed by the owner; and even if it were a thousand or ten thousand, he still would not be jailed by the owner. How is it that a person who owes a hundred coins is not jailed by the owner; and even if it were a thousand or ten thousand, he still would not<a class="t" id="434a"></a> be jailed by the owner? It means that the person who owes it has measureless means of property and has a great deal of power. Because of this, even though he owes a hundred coins, he is not jailed by the owner; and even if it were a thousand or ten thousand, he still would not be jailed by the owner. This is the meaning of a person who owes a hundred coins but who is not jailed by the owner; and even if it were a thousand or ten thousand, he still would not be jailed by the owner.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>“So it is that the person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present.

It means that this is a person who has cultivated himself, cultivated the precepts, cultivated his mind, and cultivated wisdom. His life span is quite long. This is the meaning of a person who does a deed that is not good and will surely receive a distressful result, a reward in the present. In the present, if he will receives the rewards of good and bad deeds, they will be slight.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those bhikṣus who heard what the Buddha had said were elated, took it up, and left.</p>
