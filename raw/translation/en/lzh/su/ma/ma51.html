<p>Section 5: Related to Cultivation</p>
<h1>The Ultimate Origin</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">I have heard thus:</span> Once, the Buddha travelled to Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time, the World Honored One addressed the bhikṣus: “That the craving for existence is the ultimate origin <span class="add">for it</span> is unknowable. Or is there no craving for existence at the origin? But, there does presently arise this craving for existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“The craving for existence has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate the craving for existence?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>They replied: “Non-insight (ignorance) is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Non-insight also has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate non-insight?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>They replied: “The five aggregates are its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“The five aggregates also have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate the five aggregates?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>They replied: “The three evil conducts are their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“The three evil conducts also have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate the three evil conducts?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>They replied: “Not guarding the faculties is their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Not guarding the faculties has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate not guarding the faculties?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>They replied: “Non-right mindfulness and non-right knowledge are its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“Non-right mindfulness and non-right knowledge have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate non-right mindfulness and non-right knowledge?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>They replied: “Non-right thinking is their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>“Non-right thinking has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate non-right thinking?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>They replied: “Disbelief is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>“Disbelief has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate disbelief?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>They replied: “Hearing evil Dharmas is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>“Hearing evil Dharmas has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate hearing evil Dharmas?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>They replied: “Being close to evil associates is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a>“Being close to evil associates has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate being close to evil associates?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>They replied: “Evil people are its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a>“Therefore, having been provided with evil people leads to being close to evil associates. Having been provided with being close to evil associates leads to hearing evil Dharmas. Having heard evil Dharmas leads to disbelief. Disbelief having arisen leads to non-right thinking. Having had non-right thinking leads to non-right mindfulness and non-right knowledge. Having had non-right mindfulness and non-right knowledge leads to not guarding the faculties. The faculties not having been guarded leads to the three evil conducts. Having had the three evil conducts leads to the five aggregates. Having had the five aggregates leads to non-insight. Having had non-insight leads to the craving for existence. Thus it is that this craving for existence is developed, endowed, and made complete.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a>“Insight and liberation also have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate insight and liberation?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a>They replied: “The seven branches of awakening are their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a>“The seven branches of awakening have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate the seven branches of awakening?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a>They replied: “The four stations of mindfulness are their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a>“The four stations of mindfulness have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate the four stations of mindfulness?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a>They replied: “The three sublime conducts are their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a>“The three sublime conducts have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate the three sublime conducts?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a>They replied: “Guarding the faculties is their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a>“Guarding the faculties has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate guarding the faculties?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a>They replied: “Right mindfulness and right knowledge are its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a>“Right mindfulness and right knowledge have their cultivation; they are not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate right mindfulness and right knowledge?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="35"></a>They replied: Right thinking is their cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="36"></a>“Right thinking has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate right thinking?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="37"></a>They replied: “Faith is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="38"></a>“Faith has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate faith?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="39"></a>They replied: “Hearing the good Dharma is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="40"></a>“Hearing the good Dharma has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate hearing the good Dharma?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="41"></a>They replied: “Being close to good associates is its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="42"></a>“Being close to good associates has its cultivation; it is not without any cultivation. What is said to cultivate being close to good associates?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="43"></a>They replied: “Good people are its cultivation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="44"></a>“Therefore, having been provided with good people leads to being close to good associates. Having been close to good associates leads to hearing the good Dharma. Having heard the good Dharma leads to the arising of faith. Faith having arisen leads to right thinking. Having had right thinking leads to right mindfulness and right knowledge. Having had right mindfulness and right knowledge leads to guarding the faculties. Having guarded the faculties leads to the three sublime conducts. Having had the three sublime conducts leads to the four stations of mindfulness. Having had the four stations of mindfulness leads to the seven branches of awakening. Having had the seven branches of awakening leads to insight and liberation. Thus it is that this insight and liberation are developed, endowed, and made complete.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="45"></a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those bhikṣus who had heard what the Buddha had said were elated, took it up, and left.</p>
