<p>Section 1: The Seven Dharmas</p>
<h1>The Day of Liberation Tree</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>I have heard thus: Once, the Buddha travelled to the kingdom of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At that time, the World Honored One addressed the bhikṣus: “If the leaves of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three wither and turn yellow, the gods of the Thirty-three will be delighted and encouraged, for it will not be long before the day of liberation tree’s leaves will fall.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Furthermore, once the leaves of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three have fallen, the gods of the Thirty-three will be delighted and encouraged, for it will not be long before the day of liberation tree’s leaves will begin growing back again.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Furthermore, once the leaves of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three have begun growing back again, the gods of the Thirty-three will be delighted and encouraged, for it will not be long before the day of liberation tree will grow a netting.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Furthermore, once the day of liberation tree of the Heaven of the Thirty-three has grown a netting, the gods will be delighted and encouraged, for it will not be long before the day of liberation tree will grow <span class="add">buds that resemble</span> a bird’s beak.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Furthermore, once the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three has grown <span class="add">buds that resemble</span> a bird’s beak, the gods of the Thirty-three will be delighted and encouraged, for it will not be long before the day of liberation tree’s <span class="add">buds</span> will open up like bowls.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Furthermore, once the <span class="add">buds of</span> day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three have openned like bowls, the gods of the Thirty-three will be delighted and encouraged, for it will not be long before the day of liberation tree’s <span class="add">buds</span> will be completely open. If the <span class="add">buds</span> of day of liberation tree have completely openned, the light that it casts, the colors that it reflects, and the fragrances that it exudes do so throughout an area of hundred yojanas. Then, the gods of the Thirty-three will entertain one another during the four months of Summer with the Heaven’s five desires and virtues that are perfected. This is said to be the gods of the Thirty-three gathered under the day of liberation tree to entertain <span class="add">one another</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Thus is the meaning of the Noble disciple also. He reflects on leaving home. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be yellowing <span class="add">his</span> leaves, just as when the leaves of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three wither and turn yellow.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Furthermore, the Noble disciple shaves off his hair and puts on the kaṣāya robe up to faithfully discards the home, and goes homeless to train on the Path. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be dropping <span class="add">his</span> leaves, just as when the leaves of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three fall.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Furthermore, the Noble disciple separates himself from desires, separates himself from things that are evil and not good. With awareness and investigation, he separates himself from the arising of pleasure, attains the first dhyāna, and consummates it to its utmost. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be growing his leaves back again, just as when the leaves of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three are growing back again.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“Furthermore, the Noble disciple, having had awareness and investigation, has stopped inner turmoil and is single-minded. Without awareness and without investigation, his concentration becomes blissful. He attains the second dhyāna and consummates it to its utmost. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be growing a netting, just as when the netting of the day of liberation tree in the Heaven of the Thirty-three grows.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“Furthermore, the Noble disciple separates himself from the desire for that bliss, renounces it, and so is without that pursuit. He is rightly mindful and rightly knowledgable, and aware of his physical pleasures. That is, what the Noble says and what the Noble renounces, he is mindful and happy abiding in emptiness. He attains the third dhyāna and consummates it to its utmost. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be growing <span class="add">buds that resemble</span> a bird’s beak, just as when the day of liberation tree of the Heaven of the Thirty-three grows <span class="add">buds that resemble</span> a bird’s beak.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“Furthermore, in the Noble disciple pleasure ceases and distress ceases, for the root of joy and sorrow has ceased. Not distressed and not pleased, he discards his mindfulness of the pure, attains the fourth dhyāna, and consummates it to its utmost. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be openning <span class="add">his buds</span> like bowls, just as when the <span class="add">buds of</span> the day of liberation tree of the Heaven of the Thirty-three open like bowls.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“Furthermore, the Noble disciple having brought an end to the outflows, his mind is liberated and his wisdom is liberated. Right in this present moment, he himself knows it, he himself awakens to it, and he himself has realized its consummation to its utmost: Birth has been ended; the divine practice has been established; what needed to be done has been discerned; no more to experience the existences; knowing as it really is. It is then that the Noble disciple is said to be completely openned, just as when the day of liberation tree of the Heaven of the Thirty-three completely opens.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>“Those who have ended the outflows are the Worthy bhikṣus. The gods of the Thirty-three gather around them to be with the right lords of the good Dharma, exalting them with the praises of such-and-such Noble disciples in such-and-such villages and towns who shaved off their hair and put on the kaṣāya robe up to faithfully renounced the home, and went homeless to train on the Path. Having brought an end to the outflows, their minds are liberated, their wisdom is liberated. Right in the present moment, they themselves know it, they themselves awaken to it, and they themselves have realized its consummation to its utmost: Birth has been ended; the divine practice has been established; what needed to be done has been discerned; no more to experience the existences; knowing as it really is. This is said to be the gathering of those who have ended the outflows, who are arhattvas, just as when the gods of the Thirty-three gather together under the day of liberation tree.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>The Buddha thus spoke. Those bhikṣu who heard what the Buddha had said were encouraged, took it up, and left.</p>
