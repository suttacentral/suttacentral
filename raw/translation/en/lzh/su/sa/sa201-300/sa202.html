<p>Then a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, <span class="add">[withdrew to stand to one side]</span>, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, knowing what, seeing what, does one step by step abandon the view of self and give rise to the view of not-self?</p>
<p>The Buddha said to that monk: “One rightly contemplates the eye as not-self, and one also rightly contemplates forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, as not-self.
