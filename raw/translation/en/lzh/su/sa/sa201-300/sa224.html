<h1>224. <span class="add">[First Discourse on Abandoning]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “All things <span class="add">[related to]</span> desire should be abandoned. What are all things <span class="add">[related to]</span> desire that should be abandoned? That is, the eye is <span class="add">[one of]</span> all the things <span class="add">[related to]</span> desire that should be abandoned. Forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, all these things <span class="add">[related to]</span> desire should be abandoned.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like that</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
