<h1>229. <span class="add">[Discourse on What is With Influxes and Without Influxes]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you what is of a nature to be with influxes and to be without influxes. What is of a nature to be with influxes? That is, it is the eye and forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact that is experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, <span class="add">[which is mundane]</span>.</p>
<p>“It is the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind and mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact that is experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, which is mundane. This is called being of a nature to be with influxes.</p>
<p>“What is of a nature to be without influxes? That is, it is … supramundane mind and mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, feeling arisen in dependence on mind-contact that is experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, which is supramundane. This is called being of a nature to be without influxes.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
