<h1>260. <span class="add">Discourse on Cessation</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the venerable Sāriputta approached the venerable Ānanda. Having exchanged polite greetings, the venerable Sāriputta withdrew to sit at one side and then asked the venerable Ānanda: “I would like to ask a question. Friend, would you have free time to show me the answer?”</p>
<p>Ānanda said: “Friend, you can just ask, on knowing it I shall reply.”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “Ānanda, regarding one who has <span class="add">realized</span> cessation: What is cessation? Who has <span class="add">realized</span> this cessation?”</p>
<p>Ānanda said: “Sāriputta, the five aggregates of clinging are the product of former deeds, of former intentions. They are impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of their nature to cease, this is called cessation. What are the five? That is, the bodily form aggregate of clinging is the product of former deeds, of former intentions. It is impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of its nature to cease, this is called cessation. <em>In the same way</em> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is the product of former deeds, of former intentions. It is impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of its nature to cease, this is called cessation.”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “Indeed, indeed, Ānanda, as you said: these five aggregates of clinging are the product of former deeds, of former intentions. They are impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of their nature to cease, this is called cessation. What are the five? That is, the bodily form aggregate of clinging is the product of former deeds, of former intentions. It is impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of its nature to cease, this is called cessation. <em>In the same way</em> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is the product of former deeds, of former intentions. It is impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of its nature to cease, this is called cessation.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, if these five aggregates of clinging were not the product of former deeds, <a class="t" id="t66a"></a> of former intentions, how could they cease? Ānanda, because the five aggregates of clinging are the product of former deeds, of former intentions, they are impermanent and of a nature to cease. Because of their nature to cease, this is called cessation.”</p>
<p>Then the two worthy ones delighted in hearing what each other had said and left.</p>
