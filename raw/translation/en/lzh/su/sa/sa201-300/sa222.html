<h1>222. <span class="add">[First Discourse on Understanding]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should understand all things that are to be understood, all things that are to be discerned. Listen and pay proper attention to what I shall teach you. What are all things that are to be understood, all things that are to be discerned?</p>
<p>“Monks, the eye is a thing to be understood, a thing to be discerned. Forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, all these are things to be understood, things to be discerned.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like that</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
