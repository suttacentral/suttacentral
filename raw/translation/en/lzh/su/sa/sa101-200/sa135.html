One who contemplates in this way abandons doubt in relation to the Buddha, in relation to the Dharma, in relation to the Community, and abandons doubt in relation to <i>dukkha</i>, in relation to its arising, in relation to its cessation, and in relation to the path … <span class="add">to be spoken in full up to </span>… makes an end of <i>dukkha</i>.”</p>
