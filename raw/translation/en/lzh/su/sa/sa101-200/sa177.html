<h1>177. <span class="add">[Second Discourse on Establishing Contemplation of the Body]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “It is just as if a person's turban is burning with fire, what could help him?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, he should arouse supreme desire, zeal, and energy at that time to help him to get it extinguished.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monks: “Although one might still forget about one's turban burning, one should extinguish and eradicate the thriving fire of impermanence. For the sake of eradicating the fire of impermanence, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body. For the sake of eradicating what fire of impermanence should one accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body? That is, for the sake of eradicating impermanent bodily form, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body. For the sake of eradicating impermanent feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body.” <span class="add">To be recited in full up to</span>: When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>“what is impermanent”, <span class="add">in the same way </span>“what is impermanent and of the past”, “what is impermanent and of the future”, “what is impermanent and of the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the future”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the future and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past, the future, and the present”, <span class="add">in this way eight discourses <span class="add">[are to be recited]</span> on </span>“being established in contemplating the internal body as a body”. <span class="add">In the same way eight discourses[are to be recited] on </span>“being established in contemplating the external body as a body”. <span class="add">In the same way eight discourses are to be recited as above on </span>“being established in contemplating the internal and external body as a body”.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as the twenty-four discourses on the establishment of mindfulness on the body, in the same way twenty-four discourses are to be recited as above on the establishment of mindfulness on feelings, the establishment of mindfulness on mental states, and the establishment of mindfulness on dharmas</span>.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as the ninety-six discourses on </span>“eradicating what is impermanent”, <span class="add">in the same way for </span>“one should understand”, “one should vomit out”, “one should extinguish”, “one should end”, “one should relinquish”, “one should make cease”, “one should make disappear”, <span class="add">ninety-six discourses are also to be recited for each of these as above.</span></p>
