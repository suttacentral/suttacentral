<h1>130. <span class="add">[Discourse on Seeking Out the Great Teacher]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “One who wishes to abandon the five aggregates of clinging should seek out the Great Teacher. What are the five? That is, they are the bodily form aggregate of clinging … the feeling … the perception … the formations … the consciousness aggregate of clinging. Wishing to abandon these five aggregates of clinging, one should seek out the Great Teacher.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>“one should abandon”, <span class="add">in the same way </span>“one should understand”, “one should vomit out”, “one should appease”, “one should give up” <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>seeking out “the great teacher”, <span class="add">in the same way </span>[seeking out] “the superior teacher”, “the teacher of the proper sequence”, “the instructor”, “the superior instructor”, “the instructor of the proper sequence”, “the one who has penetrated”, “the one who has widely penetrated”, “the one who has fully penetrated”, “the one who guides”, “the one who widely guides”, “the one who ultimately guides”, “the one who explains”, “the one who widely explains”, “the one who explains in proper sequence”, “the one who is upright”, “the one whois a companion”, “the one who truly is a friend”, “the one who is <span class="add">[as if he were one's]</span> relative”, “the one with empathy”, “the compassionate one”, “the guide to meaning”, “the one who comforts”, “the guide to happiness”, “the guide to experience”, “the guide to comfort”, “the one who wishes <span class="add">[one's welfare]</span>”, “the energetic one”, “the expedient one”, “the diligent one”, “the brave one”, “the firm one”, “the strong one”, “the capable one”, “the expert”, “the one whose mind does not regress”, “the stable one”, “the one who constantly practices”, “the never negligent one”, “the harmonious one”, “the considerate one”, “the recollected one”, “the awakened one”, “the understanding one”, “the knowing one”, “the wise one”, “the receptive one”, “the attentive one”, “the one who practices the holy life”, “the one established in mindfulness”, “the one with right effort”, “the one with the bases of supernormal power”, “the one with the faculties”, “the one with the powers”, “the one with the awakening factors”, “the one with the factors of the path”, “the tranquilized one”, “the insightful one”, “the one with mindfulness of the body”, “the one with right recollection”, <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
