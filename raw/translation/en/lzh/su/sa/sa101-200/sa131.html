<h1>131. <span class="add">[Discourse on Becoming Habituated]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If a recluse or Brahmin becomes habituated to bodily form,  he follows Māra's power, falls into Māra's hand, follows Māra's wishes, is bound by Māra, and is not free from Māra's fetters. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>“If a recluse or Brahmin does not become habituated to bodily form, then in this way the recluse or Brahmin does not follow Māra's power, does not fall into Māra's hand, does not follow Māra's wishes, is free from being bound by Māra, and is free from Māra's fetters. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="add">In the same way </span>“one who becomes habituated to drawing close to it”, “one who becomes habituated to being attached to it”, “one who is gratified by it”, “one who is resolved on and attached to it”, “one who rests with it”, “one who has an underlying tendency for it”, “one who approaches it”, “one who opts for it”, “one who does not give it up”, “one who does not vomit it out”. In this way a recluse or Brahmin follows Māra's power … <span class="add">as said above.</span></p>
