<h1>180. <span class="add">[Discourse on the Faculty of Confidence]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “It is just as if a person's turban is burning with fire, what could help him?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, he should arouse supreme desire, zeal, and energy at that time to help him to get it extinguished.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monks: “Although one might still forget about one's turban burning, one should extinguish and eradicate the thriving fire of impermanence. For the sake of eradicating the fire of impermanence, one should cultivate the faculty of confidence (<i>saddhā</i> ). For the sake of eradicating what impermanent states? That is, one should eradicate impermanent bodily form, one should eradicate impermanent feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, for this sake one cultivates the faculty of confidence.”</p>
<p><span class="add">In this way to be recited in full up to</span>: When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>“[one should eradicate] what is impermanent”, <span class="add">in the same way </span>“what is impermanent and of the past”, “what is impermanent and of the future”, “what is impermanent and of the present”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the future”, “what is impermanent and of the past and the present”, “what is impermanent and of the future and the present”,  “what is impermanent and of the past, the future, and the present”, <span class="add">[discourse] are also to be recited as above</span>.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as the eight discourses on </span>“the faculty of confidence”, <span class="add">in the same way on </span>“cultivating the faculty of energy”, “the faculty of mindfulness”, “the faculty of concentration”, “the faculty of wisdom”, <span class="add">eight discourses are also to be recited as above</span>.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as the forty discourses on </span>“one should eradicate”, <span class="add">in the same way for </span>“one should understand”, “one should vomit out”, “one should extinguish”, “one should end”, “one should relinquish”, “one should make cease”, “one should make disappear” <span class="add">forty discourses are also to be recited as above.</span></p>
