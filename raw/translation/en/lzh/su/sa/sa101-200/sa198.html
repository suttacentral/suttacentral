<h1>198. <span class="add">[First Discourse to Rāhula]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak.  </p>
<p>At that time the venerable Rāhula approached the Buddha, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to stand to one side, and said to the Buddha:  </p>
<p>“Blessed One, how <span class="add">[should]</span> one know and how <span class="add">[should]</span> one see so that in this body of mine with consciousness within and all external signs <span class="add">[the sense of]</span> ‘I’, ‘mine’, and the underlying tendency, fetter, and attachment to the I-conceit will not be caused to arise?”  </p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to Rāhula: “It is well, Rāhula, you are able to ask the Tathāgata about what has a very profound meaning.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rāhula: “Understand it as it really is that the eye, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all that is not self, not distinct from the self <span class="add">[in the sense of being owned by it]</span>, does not exist <span class="add">[within the self, nor does a self]</span> exist <span class="add">[within it]</span>.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class="add">is also like this.</span></p>
<p>“Rāhula, engaging in knowing like this and seeing like this, in this body of mine with consciousness within and all external signs <span class="add">[the sense of]</span> ‘I’, ‘mine’, and the underlying tendency, fetter, and attachment to the I-conceit are not caused to arise. Rāhula, in this way one does not give rise to <span class="add">[the sense of]</span> ‘I’, ‘mine’, and the underlying tendency, fetter, and attachment to the I-conceit. Rāhula this is called abandoning craving and murky views by rightly comprehending the unsurpassed transcendence of <i>dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the venerable Rāhula was delighted and received it respectfully.  </p>
<p><span class="add">As for</span> the internal sense-spheres, <span class="add">in the same way also for</span> the external sense-spheres of forms, sounds, odours, flavours, tangibles, mental objects, <span class="add">for</span> eye-consciousness … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- … and mind-consciousness, <span class="add">for</span> eye-contact … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- … and mind-contact, <span class="add">for</span> feeling arisen from eye-contact … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- … and feeling arisen from mind-contact, <span class="add">for</span> perception arisen from eye-contact … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- … and perception arisen from mind-contact, <span class="add">for</span> intention arisen from eye-contact … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- … and intention arisen from mind-contact, <span class="add">for</span> craving arisen from eye-contact … ear- … nose- … tongue- … body- … and craving arisen from mind-contact<span class="add">, <span class="add">[discourses]</span> are also to be recited as above</span>.</p>
