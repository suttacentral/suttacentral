<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this: 'If one does not enjoy the five sense pleasures, then that is Nirvāṇa here and now; if separated from evil and unwholesome states, with <span class="add">[directed]</span> awareness and <span class="add">[sustained]</span> contemplation, and with joy and happiness born of seclusion, one enters the first absorption … <span class="add">up to </span>… the fourth absorption, then that is the supreme destination of Nirvāṇa?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <span class="add">to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses.</span></p>
