</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula. Then an attendant monk by the name of Rādha, rising from meditation in the afternoon, approached the Buddha, paid respect at the Buddha's feet, withdrew to sit at one side, and said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, as the Blessed One has taught, there is penetrative understanding of bodily form, penetrative understanding of feeling …perception … formations … consciousness. Blessed One, what is penetrative understanding of bodily form, penetrative understanding of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “It is well for you to be asking this. I shall explain it to you. The eradication, fading away, cessation, appeasement, and vanishing of worry, sorrow, pain and vexation in relation to bodily form, this is called the penetrative understanding of bodily form. The eradication, fading away, cessation, appeasement, and vanishing of worry, sorrow, pain and vexation in relation to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, this is called the penetrative understanding of feeling …perception … formations … consciousness.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
