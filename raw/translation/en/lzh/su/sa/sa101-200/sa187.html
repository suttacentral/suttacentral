<h1>187. <span class="add">[Discourse on One Thing]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “Because of being endowed with one thing, one is no longer fit to understand that bodily form is impermanent, to understand that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent. What is that one thing with which one is endowed? It is lustful desires.</p>
<p>“Not being endowed with one thing,60 one is fit to understand that bodily form is impermanent, to understand that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent. What is that one thing with which one is endowed? It is being endowed with the absence of lustful desires. One who is without the condition of lustful desires is fit to understand that bodily form is impermanent, is fit to understand that feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>“being endowed and not being endowed”, <span class="add">in the same way for </span>“understanding and not understanding”, “being familiar with and not being familiar with”, “having knowledge of and not having knowledge of”, “being conscious of and not being conscious of”, “observing and not observing”, “measuring and not measuring”, “being obscured by and not being obscured by”, “propagating and not propagating”, “being covered by and not being covered by”, “being screened by and not being screened by”.</p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>“to understand”, <span class="add">in the same way for </span>“to cognize”, “to comprehend”, “to experience”, “to seek out”, “to distinguish”, “to touch”, “to realize” <span class="add">is also like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">Just as </span>“lust”, <span class="add">in the same way for </span>“hatred”, “delusion”, “anger”, “enmity”, “slandering”, “[dogmatic] grasping”, “jealousy”, “stinginess”, “deception”, “flattery”, “lack of shame”, “lack of fear of wrongdoing”, “conceit”, “superiority conceit”, “excessive conceit”, “I-conceit”, “overwhelming conceit”, “false pride”, “inferiority conceit”, “arrogance”, “negligence”, “haughtiness”, “crooked hypocrisy”, “guiding for profit”, “enticing for profit”, “evil wishes”, “many wishes”, “constant wishes”, “disrespect”, “evil speech”, “evil friends”, “impatience”, “being corrupted”, “low lust”, “evil lust”, “identity view” (<i>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i> ), “extremist view”, “wrong view”, “clinging to views”, “clinging to rules”, “desirous craving”, “hostility”, “sloth-and-torpor”, “restlessness-and-worry”, “doubt”, “being confused by anxiety”, “lameness”, “fierceness”, “laziness”, “perplexity”, “lack of right attention”, “physical dullness”, “lack of straightness”, “lack of softness”, “lack of excellence”, “thoughts of desire”, “thoughts of hatred”, “thoughts of harm”, “thoughts of one's relatives”, “thoughts of one's country”, “derisive thoughts”, “thoughts of craving for the family of others”, “distress”, “affliction”, <span class="add">with each of these states up to </span>“being screened one is not fit to realize the cessation of bodily form.”</p>
<p>“What is that one thing? It is affliction. Because of being screened by affliction, one is not fit to realize the cessation and extinction of bodily form, one is not fit to realize the cessation and extinction of feeing … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“Because of not being screened by one thing, one is fit to realize the cessation and extinction of bodily form, one is fit to realize the cessation and extinction of feeing … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“What is that one thing? It is affliction. Because of not being screened by this one thing, one is fit to realize the cessation and extinction of bodily form, one is fit to realize the cessation and extinction of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.”</p>
