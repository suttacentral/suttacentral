<h1>111. <span class="add">[Discourse on the Conduit to Becoming]</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula.3 Then an attendant monk by the name of Rādha,4 rising from meditation in the afternoon, approached the Buddha, paid respect at the Buddha's feet, withdrew to sit at one side, and said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has taught, there is a flow of becoming. What is called the flow of becoming? What is called the cessation of the flow of becoming?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “It is well for you to be asking this. I shall explain it to you, namely what is the flow of becoming. A foolish unlearned worldling does not understand as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification in bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form. Because of not understanding it as it really is, he craves for and delights in bodily form, he commends it, he grasps it, and is defiled by attachment <span class="add">[to it]</span>. In dependence on craving and delight for bodily form, there is clinging. In dependence on clinging, there is becoming. In dependence on becoming, there is birth. In dependence on birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain increase. In this way this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> arises. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>. This is called the flow of becoming.</p>
<p>“A learned noble disciple understands as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification in bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form. Because of understanding it as it really is, he does not give rise to craving and delight in regard to such bodily form, to commending it, to grasping it, or to being defiled by attachment <span class="add">[to it]</span>. Because of being without craving and delight, commending, grasping, and being defiled by attachment, craving for bodily form ceases. With the cessation of craving, clinging ceases. With the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases. With the cessation of becoming, birth ceases. With the cessation of birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, pain and vexation cease.6 In this way this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> ceases.</p>
<p>Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class="add">is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>“This is called the flow of becoming and the cessation of the flow of becoming, as taught by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
