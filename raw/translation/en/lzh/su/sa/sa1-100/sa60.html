<h1>60. <span class="add">Discourse on Not Delighting</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There are five aggregates of clinging. What are the five? That is, they are the bodily form aggregate of clinging … the feeling … the perception … the formations … the consciousness aggregate of clinging.</p>
<p>“It would be well, monks, if you do not delight in bodily form, do not commend bodily form, do not cling to bodily form, do not attach to bodily form. It would be well, monks, if you do not delight in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, do not commend consciousness, do not cling to consciousness, do not attach to consciousness. Why is that?</p>
<p>“If a monk does not delight in bodily form, does not commend bodily form, does not cling to bodily form, does not attach to bodily form, then by not delighting in bodily form his mind attains liberation. In the same way <span class="add">if he</span> does not delight in feeling <a class="t" id="t15c"></a> … perception … formations … does not delight in consciousness, does not commend consciousness, does not cling to consciousness, does not attach to consciousness, then by not delighting in consciousness his mind attains liberation.</p>
<p>“If a monk does not delight in bodily form and his mind has attained liberation … in the same way <span class="add">if he</span> does not delight in feeling … perception … formations … consciousness and his mind has attained liberation, <span class="add">for him</span> there is no perishing and no <span class="add">re-</span>arising, he is established in balanced equanimity, with right mindfulness and right comprehension.</p>
<p>“That monk, who understands like this and sees like this, has forever eradicated the view of the past without a remainder. The view of the past having been forever eradicated without a remainder, he has also forever eradicated the view of the future without a remainder. The view of the future having been forever eradicated without a remainder, he has also forever eradicated the view of the present without a remainder and is not attached to anything.</p>
<p>“One who is not attached to anything does not cling to anything in the whole world. One who does not cling to anything does not seek for anything. One who does not seek for anything personally realizes Nirvāṇa, <span class="add">knowing</span>: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
