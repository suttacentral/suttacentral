<h1>9. <span class="add">Discourse on Disenchantment</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“Bodily form is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i>dukkha</i>, what is <i>dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly. <span class="add">In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent, what is impermanent is <i>dukkha</i>, what is <i>dukkha</i> is not-self, what is not self is not mine. One who contemplates like this is reckoned to be contemplating truly and rightly.</p>
<p>“A noble disciple who contemplates like this becomes disenchanted with bodily form, disenchanted with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. Because of disenchantment he does not delight <span class="add">in consciousness</span>, because of not delighting <span class="add">in consciousness</span> he attains liberation. To one who is liberated the true knowledge arises: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”</p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
