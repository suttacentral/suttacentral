<h1>66. <span class="add">Discourse on Arising</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should constantly cultivate meditation with diligence, calm the mind within. Why is that? Having cultivated meditation with diligence and calmed the mind within, one examines <span class="add">the aggregates</span> as they really are.</p>
<p>“How to examine <span class="add">the aggregates</span> as they really are? By examining as it really is: ‘This is bodily form, this is the arising of bodily form, this is the cessation of bodily form. This is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the cessation of consciousness.’</p>
<p>“What is the arising of bodily form? What is the arising of feeling … of perception … of formations … of consciousness? Monks, because a foolish unlearned worldling does not examine as it really is the arising of bodily form, <span class="add">the cessation of bodily form</span>, the gratification of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form, he delights in that bodily form, he commends craving and attachment for it, and he gives rise to further bodily form in the future … feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>should also be recited fully in the same way</i>.</p>
<p>“That bodily form having arisen, feeling … perception … formations … consciousness having arisen, he is not liberated from bodily form, he is not liberated from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I say, he is not liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain, from this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i>. This is called the arising of bodily form, the arising of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“What is the cessation of bodily form? What is the cessation of feeling … of perception … of formations … of consciousness? A learned noble disciple examines as it really is the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form, understanding it as it really is. Because of understanding it as it really is, <a class="t" id="t17c"></a> he does not delight in bodily form, he does not commend bodily form. Not delighting with attachment in bodily form, he also does not give rise to bodily form in the future … feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>should also be recited fully in the same way</i>.</p>
<p>“Because of not giving rise to bodily form, not giving rise to feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, he attains liberation from bodily form, attains liberation from feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. I say, he is liberated from birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, vexation, and pain, from this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i>. This is called the cessation of bodily form, the cessation of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, you should constantly cultivate meditation with diligence, calm the mind within, make a diligent effort to examine <span class="add">the aggregates</span> as they really are.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>As for</i> ‘examining’, <i>in the same way … up to …</i> ‘realizing’, <i>twelve discourses should be recited fully in the same way</i>.</p>
