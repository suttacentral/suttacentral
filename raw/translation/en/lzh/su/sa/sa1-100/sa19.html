<h1>19. <span class="add">Discourse on Being Bound by Fetters</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk rose from his seat, paid homage to the Buddha and said to the Buddha: <a class="t" id="t4b"></a></p>
<p>“<span class="add">May</span> the Blessed One teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy, being established in it without negligence. Having become established in it without negligence, I shall reflect on that for whose sake a clansman’s son out of right faith goes forth from the home to homelessness … up to … I myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to that monk: “It is well, it is well, that you speak like this: ‘It would be well if the Blessed One would teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma, I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy, being established in it without negligence … up to … knowing myself that there will be no receiving of further existence.’ Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen, listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. Monk, the fetters and what has the nature of putting you in bondage should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace for a long time.” Then that monk said to the Buddha: “I understood, Blessed One, I understood Well Gone One!”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, bodily form is of the nature to fetter and put me in bondage. This nature to fetter put me in bondage should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace for a long time. <span class="add">In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is of the nature to fetter and put me in bondage. This nature to fetter put me in bondage should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace for a long time. Blessed One, I thus understand in full the meaning of the teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well, that you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief. Why is that? Bodily form is of the nature to fetter and put you in bondage. This thing should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace for a long time. <span class="add">In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is of the nature to fetter and put you in bondage. This thing should quickly be relinquished and eradicated. Having eradicated that thing will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace for a long time.”</p>
<p>Then, on hearing what the Buddha had said, the mind of that monk was greatly delighted. He paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew. Reflecting on it alone in a quiet place with diligence he was established in being without negligence … up to <i>…</i> attaining liberation of the mind he became an arahant.</p>
