<h1>70. <span class="add">Discourse on True Realization</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you what is on the side of identity (<i>sakkāyanta</i>), the arising of what is on the side of identity, and the cessation of what is on the side of identity. Listen and pay careful attention to what I shall tell you. What is on the side of identity? That is, it is the five aggregates of clinging. What are the five? They are the bodily form aggregate of clinging … the feeling … the perception … the formations … the consciousness aggregate of clinging. This is called what is on the side of identity.</p>
<p>“What is the arising of what is on the side of identity? That is, it is craving for experiencing future becoming, which is conjoined with lust and joy, delighting with attachment here and there—this is called the arising of what is on the side of identity.</p>
<p>“What is the cessation of what is on the side of identity? That is, it is the abandoning without remainder of this craving to experience future becoming, which is conjoined with lust and joy, delighting with attachment here and there, its vomiting out, its eradication, its fading away, its cessation, its appeasement, its disappearance—this is called the cessation of what is on the side of identity.</p>
<p>“For this reason <span class="add">I said</span>: ‘I will teach you what is on the side of identity, the arising of what is on the side of identity, and the cessation of what is on the side of identity’.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>As for</i> “I will teach“, <i><span class="add">so with</span></i> “there is” <i>and</i> “you should understand” <i><span class="add">three discourses</span> are to be recited in the same way</i>.</p>
