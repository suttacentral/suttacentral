<h1>68. <span class="add">Discourse on the Six Sense-spheres</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should constantly cultivate meditation with diligence, calm the mind within, and examine <span class="add">the aggregates</span> as they really are.</p>
<p>“How to examine <span class="add">the aggregates</span> as they really are? By understanding as it really is: ‘This is bodily form, this is the arising of bodily form, this is the cessation of bodily form. This is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the cessation of consciousness.’</p>
<p>“What is the arising of bodily form, the arising of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness? In dependence on eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. With the coming together of the three, contact arises. In dependence on contact, feeling arises. In dependence on feeling, craving arises … <i>up to </i>… this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> arises. This is called the arising of bodily form.</p>
<p>“In the same way in dependence on ear … nose … tongue … body … the mind and mental objects, mind-consciousness arises. With the coming together of the three, contact arises. In dependence on contact, feeling arises. In dependence on feeling, craving arises … <i>in the same way up to </i>… this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> arises. This is called the arising of bodily form, the arising of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“What is the cessation of bodily form, the cessation of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness? In dependence on eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. With the coming together of the three, contact arises. With the cessation of contact, feeling ceases … <i>up to </i>… this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> ceases.</p>
<p>“<span class="add">In the same way</span> in dependence on ear … nose … tongue … body … the mind and mental objects, mind-consciousness arises. With the coming together of the three, contact arises. With the cessation of contact, feeling ceases. With the cessation of feeling … <i>up to </i>… this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> ceases. This is called the cessation of bodily form, the cessation of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, you should constantly cultivate meditation with diligence, calm the mind within.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>As for</i> ‘examining’ <i>… up to …</i> ‘realizing’, <i>twelve discourses should be recited fully in the same way.</i></p>
