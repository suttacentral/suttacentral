<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew to stand at one side. <a class="t" id="t4a"></a> He said to the Buddha:</p>
<p>“It would be well if the Blessed One would teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy. Being established in it without negligence … up to … knowing myself that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to that monk: “It is well, it is well, that you speak like this: ‘Blessed One, teach me the essentials of the Dharma in brief. On having heard the Dharma, I shall alone and in a quiet place reflect on it with energy. Being established in it without negligence … up to … knowing myself that there will be no receiving of further existence.’ Is it like this?” Then that monk said to the Buddha: “It is like this, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen, listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you. Whatever does not belong to you and does not belong to others, these things should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having eradicated those things will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace for a long time.” Then that monk said to the Buddha: “I understood, Blessed One, I understood Well Gone One!”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, bodily form is not self, it does not belong to me and does not belong to others. This thing should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having eradicated that thing will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace for a long time. <span class="add">In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is not self, it does not belong to me and does not belong to others. It should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having eradicated that thing will be for my benefit and welfare, for my peace for a long time. Blessed One, I thus understand in full the meaning of the teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well, that you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief. Why is that? Monk, bodily form is not self, it does not belong to oneself and does not belong to others. This thing should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having eradicated that thing will be for one’s benefit and welfare, for one’s peace for a long time. <span class="add">In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is not self, it does not belong to oneself and does not belong to others. This thing should quickly be eradicated and relinquished. Having eradicated that thing will be for one’s benefit and welfare, for one’s peace for a long time.”</p>
<p>Then, on hearing what the Buddha had said, the mind of that monk was greatly delighted. He paid homage to the Buddha and withdrew. Practising alone in a quiet place with diligence he was established in being without negligence … up to <i>…</i> he himself knew that there will be no receiving of further existence. Then that monk, attaining liberation of the mind, became an arahant.</p>
