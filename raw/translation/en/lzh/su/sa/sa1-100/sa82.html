<h1>82. <span class="add">Discourse at the Bamboo Park</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at the dwelling of the <span class="add">Eastern</span> Bamboo Park among the Cetis.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “What does a learned noble disciple regard as impermanent and <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of Dharma,</p>
<p>the foundation of the Dharma. May he teach us! Having heard it, the monks will receive it respectfully as he has taught it.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monks: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I shall tell you. A learned noble disciple regards bodily form as impermanent and <i>dukkha</i>, <a class="t" id="t21b"></a> he regards feeling … perception … formations … consciousness as impermanent and <i>dukkha.</i> Monks, is bodily form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><span class="add">The Buddha said</span>: “Monks, what is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><span class="add">The Buddha said</span>: “Monks, what is impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self, as distinct from the self <span class="add">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, as existing <span class="add">within the self, or the self</span> as existing <span class="add">within it</span>?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “No, Blessed One.”</p>
<p><span class="add">The Buddha said</span>: “Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>are also like this</i>. Therefore, monks, whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, all of it is entirely not self, not distinct from the self <span class="add">in the sense of being owned by it</span>, does not exist <span class="add">within the self, nor does a self</span> exist <span class="add">within it</span>. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>are also like this.</i></p>
<p>“A learned noble disciple who examines it in this way becomes disenchanted with bodily form, becomes disenchanted with feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. Because of being disenchanted, he does not delight in it. Because of not delighting in it, he is liberated from it. Because of being liberated, <span class="add">he understands:</span> ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of further existence.’”</p>
<p>Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
