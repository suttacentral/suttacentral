<h1>69. <span class="add">Discourse on the Path</span></h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you the path to the arising of identity (<i>sakkāya</i>) and the path to the cessation of the arisen identity.</p>
<p>“What is the path to the arising of identity? A foolish unlearned worldling does not understand as it really is <span class="add">bodily form</span>, the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form. <a class="t" id="t18b"></a></p>
<p>“Because of not understanding it as it really is, he delights in bodily form, commends bodily form, is attached to bodily form, and becomes established on bodily form. Because of delighting in bodily form, commending bodily form, being attached to bodily form, and becoming established on bodily form, he clings to it with craving and delight. In dependence on clinging, there is becoming. In dependence on becoming, there is birth. In dependence on birth, there is old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, pain, and vexation. In this way this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> arises.</p>
<p>“<span class="add">In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>are to be recited fully</i>. This is called the path to the arising of identity. Monks, you should know that the path to the arising of identity is the path to the arising of <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“What is the path to the cessation of the arisen identity? A learned noble disciple understands as it really is bodily form, the arising of bodily form, the cessation of bodily form, the gratification of bodily form, the danger in bodily form, and the escape from bodily form.</p>
<p>“Because of understanding it as it really is, he does not delight in bodily form, does not commend it, is not attached to it, and does not become established on it. Because of not delighting in it, not commending it, not being attached to it, and not becoming established on it, craving and delight for bodily form cease. With the cessation of craving and delight, clinging ceases. With the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases. With the cessation of becoming, birth ceases. With the cessation of birth, old age, disease, death, worry, sorrow, pain, and vexation <span class="add">cease</span>, and this entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i> ceases.</p>
<p>“<i>As for</i> bodily form, <i>in the same way for</i> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness. This is called the path to the cessation of identity. The path to the cessation of identity is the path to the cessation of <i>dukkha</i>. Therefore I have taught you the path to the cessation of identity.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><i>As for</i> “I will teach“, <i><span class="add">so with</span></i> “there is” <i>and</i> “you should understand” <i><span class="add">three discourses</span> should be recited in the same way</i>.</p>
