<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. Once the Awakened One dwelt in Sravasti City, Jeta’s Grove, and Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time the World Honoured One told the mendicants:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“There are five types of seeds. What are the five? They are: the root seed, the stalk seed, the node seed, the seed that falls by itself and the fruit seed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“These five <span class="add">types of</span> seeds, not cut off, not broken down, not decayed, <span class="add">and</span> not carried away by the wind, <span class="add">but</span> new, ripe, strong and true, if these seeds have the earth element, but not the water element, they will not grow and increase. If those seeds new, ripe, strong and true <span class="add">and</span> not cut off, not broken down, <span class="add">not decayed and</span> not carried away by the wind, have the water element, but do not have the earth element, they will also not grow and increase. If those seeds new, ripe, strong and true <span class="add">and</span> not cut off, not broken down, not decayed <span class="add">and</span> not carried away by the wind, have the water element and the earth element, they will grow and increase.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Mendicants! Those five seeds are like the clinging aggregate of consciousness. The earth element is like the four abidings of consciousness. The water element is like passion and desire. <span class="add">There are</span> four clingings causing consciousness to abide. What are the four? In the midst of forms consciousness abides. Clinging causes form and vigorous passionate desire to arise to grow and increase. Consciousness abides in feeling, concept and formulation. Clinging causes feeling, concept and formulation and vigorous passionate desire to arise to grow and increase.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Mendicants! Consciousness with regard to the middle <span class="add">way</span> may come, may go, may abide, may cease, may arise and grow and increase. Mendicants! If <span class="add">it</span> leaves form, feeling, concept and formulation, consciousness is there, may be coming, going, abiding or arising, but then it is <span class="add">just</span> a way of speaking. Asking and not knowing, increases confusion without limit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“If one abandons desire for the form element, having left it, the ties that arise and block the mind in form are cut off. Having cut off the ties that blocked the mind that arise in form, <span class="add">then</span> the cause of clinging is cut off. The cause of clinging having been cut off, <span class="add">that</span> consciousness has no place to abide and <span class="add">there is</span> no re-birth and growth and increase.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“If one abandons desire for feeling, concept and formulation elements, having left it, the ties that arise and block the mind in … formulation are cut off. Having cut off the ties that blocked the mind that arise in … formulation, <span class="add">then</span> the cause of clinging is cut off. The cause of clinging having been cut off, that consciousness <span class="add">has</span> no <span class="add">means by</span> which to abide and <span class="add">there is</span> no re-birth and growth and increase. Because <span class="add">there is</span> no more birth, formulations are not created, not having created formulations, <span class="add">there is</span> abiding. Having abided, <span class="add">there is</span> contentment, there being contentment, <span class="add">there is</span> liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Being liberated in the world there is no <span class="add">thing to</span> which to cling <span class="add">and</span> no <span class="add">thing to</span> which to hold on. <span class="add">There being</span> no <span class="add">thing to</span> which to cling, or to which <span class="add">one is</span> to hold on to, one realises extinguishment. <span class="add">One knows:</span> ‘For me birth is finished. The Holy Life is established. Done is what had to be done.’ One knows: ‘<span class="add">I will</span> not experience future becoming.’ I say this consciousness will not reach <span class="add">the four directions:</span> north, south, east or west. <span class="add">It will also</span> not reach above and below. <span class="add">There is</span> nowhere that it goes to. I see only dhammas. Desire is extinct, calm, finished. Feeling is cooled. Feeling is pure. <span class="add">This is the</span> real fruit.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>The Awakened One gave this discourse. The mendicants heard what the Awakened One said, were very happy and respectfully practised <span class="add">it</span>.</p>
