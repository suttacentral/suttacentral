<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others. What five? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is not accomplished in virtuous behavior himself and does not encourage others to become accomplished in virtuous behavior; (2) he is not accomplished in concentration himself and does not encourage others to become accomplished in concentration; (3) he is not accomplished in wisdom himself and does not encourage others to become accomplished in wisdom; (4) he is not accomplished in liberation himself and does not encourage others to become accomplished in liberation; (5) he is not accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation himself and does not encourage others to become accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.14"></a> Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is practicing neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others.”</p>
