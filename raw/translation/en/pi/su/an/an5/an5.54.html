<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five unfavorable occasions for striving. What five? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.66"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is old, overcome by old age. This is the first unfavorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(2) “Again, a bhikkhu is ill, overcome by illness. This is the second unfavorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(3) “Again, there is a famine, a poor harvest, a time when almsfood is difficult to obtain and it is not easy to subsist by means of gleaning. This is the third unfavorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(4) “Again, there is peril, turbulence in the wilderness, and the people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all sides. This is the fourth unfavorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>(5) “Again, there is a schism in the Saṅgha, and when there is a schism in the Saṅgha there are mutual insults, mutual reviling, mutual disparagement, and mutual rejection. Then those without confidence do not gain confidence, while some of those with confidence change their minds. This is the fifth unfavorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“These are the five unfavorable occasions for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“There are, bhikkhus, these five favorable occasions for striving. What five?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>(1) “Here, a bhikkhu is young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. This is the first favorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>(2) “Again, a bhikkhu is seldom ill or afflicted, possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving. This is the second favorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>(3) “Again, food is plentiful; there has been a good harvest <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.67"></a> and almsfood is abundant, so that one can easily sustain oneself by means of gleaning. This is the third favorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>(4) “Again, people are dwelling in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection. This is the fourth favorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>(5) “Again, the Saṅgha is dwelling at ease—in concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single recitation. When the Saṅgha is in concord, there are no mutual insults, no mutual reviling, no mutual disparagement, and no mutual rejection. Then those without confidence gain confidence and those with confidence increase <span class="add">in their confidence</span>. This is the fifth favorable occasion for striving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“These are the five favorable occasions for striving.”</p>
