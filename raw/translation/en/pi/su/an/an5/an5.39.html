<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, considering five prospects, mother and father wish for a son to be born in their family. What five? (1) ‘Having been supported by us, he will support us. (2) Or he will do work for us. (3) Our family lineage will be extended. (4) He will manage the inheritance, (5) or else, when we have passed on, he will give an offering on our behalf.’ Considering these five prospects, mother and father wish for a son to be born in their family.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Considering the five prospects,<br>
wise people wish for a son.<br>
“Supported by us, he will support us,<br>
or he will do work for us.<br>
The family lineage will be extended,<br>
he will manage the inheritance,<br>
or else, when we have passed on,<br>
he will make an offering on our behalf.”<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Considering these prospects,<br>
wise people wish for a son.<br>
Therefore good persons,<br>
grateful and appreciative,<br>
support their mother and father,<br>
recalling how they helped one in the past; <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.44"></a><br>
they do what is necessary for them<br>
as they did for oneself in the past.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Following their advice,<br>
nurturing those who brought him up,<br>
continuing the family lineage,<br>
endowed with faith, virtuous:<br>
this son is worthy of praise.<br></p>
