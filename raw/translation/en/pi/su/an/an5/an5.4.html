<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.4"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five <span class="add">other</span> qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”</p>
