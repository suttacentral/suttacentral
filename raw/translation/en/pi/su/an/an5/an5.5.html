<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life. What five? (1) ‘You did not have faith in <span class="add">cultivating</span> wholesome qualities. (2) You did not have a sense of moral shame in <span class="add">cultivating</span> wholesome qualities. (3) You did not have moral dread in <span class="add">cultivating</span> wholesome qualities. (4) You did not have energy in <span class="add">cultivating</span> wholesome qualities. (5) You did not have wisdom in <span class="add">cultivating</span> wholesome qualities.’ Any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who gives up the training and reverts to the lower life incurs these five reasonable criticisms and grounds for censure in this very life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who lives the complete and pure spiritual life, even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, gains five reasonable grounds for praise in this very life.
