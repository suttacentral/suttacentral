<h1>34. Sīha</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Sīha the general approached <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.39"></a> the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Is it possible, Bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving?”</p>
<p>“It is, Sīha,” the Blessed One said.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(1) “A donor, Sīha, a munificent giver, is dear and agreeable to many people. This is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(2) “Again, good persons resort to a donor, a munificent giver. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(3) “Again, a donor, a munificent giver, acquires a good reputation. This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>(4) “Again, whatever assembly a donor, a munificent giver, approaches—whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—he approaches it confidently and composed. This too is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>(5) “Again, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. This is a fruit of giving pertaining to future lives.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. For I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I am dear and agreeable to many people. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and many good persons resort to me. I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation as a donor, sponsor, and supporter of the Saṅgha. I <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.40"></a> am a donor, a munificent giver, and whatever assembly I approach—whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—I approach it confidently and composed. I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him. I know them, too. But when the Blessed One tells me: ‘Sīha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world,’ I do not know this, and here I go by faith in the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“So it is, Sīha, so it is! With the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>By giving, he becomes dear and many resort to him.<br>
He attains a good reputation and his fame increases.<br>
The generous man is composed<br>
and confidently enters the assembly.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>Therefore, seeking happiness,<br>
wise persons give gifts,<br>
having removed the stain of miserliness.<br>
When they are settled in the triple heaven,<br>
for a long time they delight<br>
in companionship with the devas.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Having taken the opportunity to do wholesome deeds,<br>
passing from here, self-luminous, they roam in Nandana,<br>
where they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves,<br>
furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure.<br>
Having fulfilled the word of the unattached Stable One,<br>
the Fortunate One’s disciples rejoice in heaven. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.41"></a><br></p>
