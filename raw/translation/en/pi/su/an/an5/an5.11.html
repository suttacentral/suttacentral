<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I claim to have attained the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge regarding things not heard before.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are these five Tathāgata’s powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five Tathāgata’s powers that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.10"></a></p>
