<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. <span class="add">Now on that occasion Queen Mallikā had just died.</span> Then a man approached King Pasendi and whispered in his ear: “Sire, Queen Mallikā has just died.” When this was said, King Pasenadi was pained and saddened, and he sat there with slumping shoulders, facing downward, glum, and speechless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Blessed One, having known the king’s condition, said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><span class="add">The rest of this sutta is identical with 5:48, including the verses.</span></p>
