<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee’s powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee’s powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will possess the power of faith, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of moral dread, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of energy, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee’s power.’ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.” <span class="add">This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.2"></a></p>
