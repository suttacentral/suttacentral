<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, <span class="add">thinking</span>: ‘How can I be endowed with faith … and also be one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(10) “But when a bhikkhu is <span class="add roman">i</span> endowed with faith, <span class="add roman">ii</span> virtuous, and <span class="add roman">iii</span> learned; <span class="add roman">iv</span> a speaker on the Dhamma; <span class="add roman">v</span> one who frequents assemblies; <span class="add roman">vi</span> one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly; <span class="add roman">vii</span> an expert on the discipline; <span class="add roman">viii</span> a forest-dweller who resorts to remote lodgings; <span class="add roman">ix</span> one who dwells having contacted with the body those peaceful emancipations, transcending forms, that are formless; and <span class="add roman">x</span> one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it, then he is complete with respect to that factor.</p>
