<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhante, how many reasons are there for suspending the Pātimokkha?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There are, Upāli, ten reasons for suspending the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1) One who has committed a <em>pārājika</em> is sitting in that assembly; (2) a discussion about one who has committed a <em>pārājika</em> is underway; (3) one not fully ordained is sitting in that assembly; <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.71"></a> (4) a discussion about one not fully ordained is underway; (5) one who has given up the training is sitting in that assembly; (6) a discussion about one who has given up the training is underway; (7) a eunuch is sitting in that assembly; (8) a discussion about a eunuch is underway; (9) a seducer of a bhikkhunī is sitting in that assembly; (10) a discussion about a seducer of a bhikkhunī is underway. These are the ten reasons for suspending the Pātimokkha.”</p>
