<h1>59. Going Forth</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘Our minds will be strengthened in accordance with <span class="add">the spirit of</span> our going forth, and arisen bad unwholesome qualities will not obsess our minds. (1) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of impermanence. (2) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of non-self. (3) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of unattractiveness. (4) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of danger. (5) We will know the even and uneven ways of the world, and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (6) We will know the coming into being and extermination of the world, and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (7) We will know the origination and passing away of the world, and our minds will be strengthened in this perception. (8) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of abandoning. (9) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of dispassion. (10) Our minds will be strengthened in the perception of cessation.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.108"></a> It is in such a way that you should you train yourselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“When a bhikkhu’s mind has been strengthened in accordance with <span class="add">the spirit of</span> his going forth, and arisen bad unwholesome qualities do not obsess his mind—when his mind has been strengthened in the perception of impermanence … when his mind has been strengthened in the perception of cessation—one of two fruits is to be expected for him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”</p>
