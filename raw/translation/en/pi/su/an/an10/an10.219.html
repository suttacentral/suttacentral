<h1>219. The Deed-Born Body</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not say that there is a termination of volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated so long as one has not experienced <span class="add">its results</span>, and that may be in this very life, or in the <span class="add">next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion. But I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced <span class="add">the results of</span> volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“This noble disciple, bhikkhus, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He understands thus: ‘Previously, my mind was limited and undeveloped, but now it is measureless and well developed. No measurable kamma remains or persists there.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.300"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“What do you think, bhikkhus, if a youth were to develop the liberation of mind by loving-kindness from his childhood on, would he do a bad deed?”</p>
<p>“No, Bhante.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Could suffering affect him if he does no bad deed?” “No, Bhante. For on what account could suffering affect one who does no bad deed?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“A woman or a man should develop this liberation of mind by loving-kindness. A woman or a man cannot take this body with them when they go. Mortals have mind as their core.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“<span class="add">The noble disciple</span> understands: ‘Whatever bad deed I did here in the past with this deed-born body is all to be experienced here. It will not follow along.’ When the liberation of mind by loving-kindness has been developed in this way, it leads to non-returning for a wise bhikkhu here who does not penetrate to a further liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“This noble disciple, bhikkhus, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He understands thus: ‘Previously, my mind was limited and undeveloped, but now it is measureless and well developed. No measurable <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.301"></a> kamma remains or persists there.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“What do you think, bhikkhus, if a youth would develop the liberation of mind by equanimity, from his childhood on, would he do a bad deed?”</p>
<p>“No, Bhante.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Could suffering affect him if he does no bad deed?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“No, Bhante. For on what account could suffering affect one who does no bad deed?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“A woman or a man should develop this liberation of mind by equanimity. A woman or a man cannot take this body with them when they go. Mortals have mind as their core.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“<span class="add">The noble disciple</span> understands: ‘Whatever bad deed I did here in the past with this deed-born body is all to be experienced here. It will not follow along.’ When the liberation of mind by equanimity has been developed in this way, it leads to non-returning for a wise bhikkhu here who does not penetrate to a further liberation.”</p>
