<h1>53. Standstill</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not praise even a standstill in wholesome qualities, much less decline. I praise only growth in wholesome qualities, not a standstill or deterioration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how is there deterioration—not a standstill or growth—in wholesome qualities? Here, a bhikkhu has a certain degree of faith, virtuous behavior, learning, renunciation, wisdom, and discernment. Those qualities of his do not remain the same or increase. This, I say, is deterioration rather than a standstill or growth in wholesome qualities. Thus there is deterioration—not a standstill or growth—in wholesome qualities.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others’ minds <span class="add">should train</span>: ‘I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.’ … [97–98] … <span class="add">as in 10:51 down to:</span> … But if, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: ‘I am often without longing … and concentrated,’ then he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.”</p>
