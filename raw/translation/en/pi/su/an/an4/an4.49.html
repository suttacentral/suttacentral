<h1>49. Perversions</h1>
</div>
<p>“Monks, there are these four perversions of perception, perversions of mind, perversions of view. Which four? ‘Constant’ with regard to the inconstant is a perversion of perception, a perversion of mind, a perversion of view. ‘Pleasant’ with regard to the stressful… ‘Self’ with regard to not-self… ‘Attractive’ with regard to the unattractive is a perversion of perception, a perversion of mind, a perversion of view. These are the four perversions of perception, perversions of mind, perversions of view.</p>
<p>“There are these four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of mind, non-perversions of view. Which four? ‘Inconstant’ with regard to the inconstant is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of mind, a non-perversion of view. ‘Stressful’ with regard to the stressful… ‘Not-self’ with regard to not-self… ‘Unattractive’ with regard to the unattractive is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of mind, a non-perversion of view. These are the four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of mind, non-perversions of view.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha"><p>Perceiving constancy in the inconstant,  <br>pleasure in the stressful,  <br>self in what’s not-self,  <br>attractiveness in the unattractive, <br>beings, destroyed by wrong-view, go mad, out of their minds. <br>Bound to Mara’s yoke, <br>from the yoke they find no rest. <br>Beings go on to the wandering-on, <br>leading to birth & death. <br>But when Awakened Ones <br>arise in the world, <br>bringing light to the world, <br>they proclaim the Dhamma <br>leading to the stilling of stress. <br>When those with discernment listen, <br>they regain their senses, <br>seeing the inconstant as inconstant,  <br>the stressful as stressful, <br>what’s not-self as not-self,  <br>the unattractive as unattractive. <br>Undertaking right view, <br>they transcend all stress & suffering. </p></blockquote>
