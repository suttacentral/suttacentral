<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. What four? Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Giving, endearing speech,<br>
beneficent conduct, and impartiality<br>
under diverse worldly conditions,<br>
as is suitable to fit each case: these means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship<br>
are like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>If there were no such means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship,<br>
neither mother nor father<br>
would be able to obtain esteem<br>
and veneration from their children.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>But since there exist these means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship,<br>
wise people respect them;<br>
thus they attain to greatness<br>
and are highly praised. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.33"></a><br></p>
