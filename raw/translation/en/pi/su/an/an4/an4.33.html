<h1>33. The Lion</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair, stretches his body, surveys the four quarters all around, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out in search of game.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Whatever animals hear the lion roaring for the most part are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror. Those who live in holes enter their holes; those who live in the water enter the water; those who live in the woods enter the woods; and the birds resort to the sky. Even those royal bull elephants, bound by strong thongs in the villages, towns, and capital cities, burst and break their bonds asunder; frightened, they urinate and defecate and flee here and there. So powerful among the animals is the lion, the king of beasts, so majestic and mighty.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“So too, bhikkhus, when the Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, he teaches the Dhamma thus: ‘(1) Such is personal existence, (2) such the origin of personal existence, (3) such the cessation of personal existence, (4) such the way to the cessation of personal existence.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“When those devas who are long-lived, beautiful, abounding in happiness, dwelling for a long time in lofty palaces, hear the Tathāgata’s teaching of the Dhamma, for the most part they are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror thus: ‘It seems that we are actually impermanent, though we thought ourselves permanent; it seems that we are actually transient, though we thought ourselves everlasting; it seems that we are actually non-eternal, though we thought ourselves eternal. It seems that we are impermanent, transient, non-eternal, included in personal existence.’ So powerful is the Tathāgata, so majestic and mighty is he in this world together with its devas.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.34"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>When, through direct knowledge,<br>
the Buddha, the teacher, the peerless person<br>
in this world with its devas,<br>
sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma,<br><span class="add">he teaches</span> personal existence, its cessation,<br>
the origin of personal existence,<br>
and the noble eightfold path<br>
that leads to the calming down of suffering.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Then even those devas with long life spans—<br>
beautiful, ablaze with glory—<br>
become fearful and filled with terror,<br>
like beasts who hear the lion’s roar.<br>
“It seems that we are impermanent,<br>
not beyond personal existence,” <span class="add">they say</span>,<br>
when they hear the word of the Arahant,<br>
the Stable One who is fully freed.<br></p>
