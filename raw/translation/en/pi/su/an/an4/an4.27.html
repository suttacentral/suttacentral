<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four trifles, easily gained and blameless. What four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “A rag-robe is a trifle among robes, easily gained <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.27"></a> and blameless. (2) A lump of almsfood is a trifle among meals, easily gained and blameless. (3) The foot of a tree is a trifle among lodgings, easily gained and blameless. (4) Putrid urine is a trifle among medicines, easily gained and blameless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“These are the four trifles, easily gained and blameless. When a bhikkhu is satisfied with what is trifling and easily gained, I say that he has one of the factors of the ascetic life.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>When one is content with what is blameless,<br>
trifling and easily gained;<br>
when one’s mind is not distressed<br>
because of a lodging,<br>
robe, drink, and food,<br>
one is not hindered anywhere.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>These qualities, rightly said<br>
to conform to the ascetic life,<br>
are acquired by a bhikkhu<br>
who is content and heedful.<br></p>
