<h1>1. Peril</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, whatever perils arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Whatever calamities arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Whatever misfortunes arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Just as a fire that starts in a house made of reeds or grass burns down even a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed; so too, whatever perils arise … all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. (1) Thus, bhikkhus, the fool brings peril, the wise person brings no peril; (2) the fool brings calamity, the wise person brings no calamity; (3) the fool brings misfortune, the wise person brings no misfortune. There is no peril from the wise person; there is no calamity from the wise person; there is no misfortune from the wise person.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and practice the three qualities possessing which one is known as a wise person.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.102"></a></p>
