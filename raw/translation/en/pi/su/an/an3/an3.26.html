<h1>26. To be Associated With</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? (1) There is a person who is not to be associated with, followed, and served; (2) a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served; and (3) <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.125"></a> a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “And what kind of person, bhikkhus, is not to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is inferior <span class="add">to oneself</span> in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is not to be associated with, followed, and served except out of sympathy and compassion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(2) “And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served? Here, some person is similar <span class="add">to oneself</span> in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served. For what reason? <span class="add">Because one considers:</span> ‘Since we are similar with regard to virtuous behavior, we will have a discussion on virtuous behavior, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease. Since we are similar with regard to concentration, we will have a discussion on concentration, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease. Since we are similar with regard to wisdom, we will have a discussion on wisdom, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease.’ Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(3) “And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect? Here, some person is superior <span class="add">to oneself</span> in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect. For what reason? <span class="add">Because one considers:</span> ‘In such a way I will fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have fulfilled. I will fulfill the aggregate of concentration that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of concentration that I have fulfilled. I will fulfill the aggregate of wisdom that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of wisdom that I have fulfilled.’ Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.126"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>One who associates with an inferior person declines;<br>
one who associates with an equal does not decline;<br>
attending on a superior person one develops quickly;<br>
therefore you should follow one superior to yourself.<br></p>
