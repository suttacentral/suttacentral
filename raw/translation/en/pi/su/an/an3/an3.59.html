<h1>59. Jāṇussoṇī</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Master Gotama, whoever has a sacrifice, a memorial meal, an offering dish, or something to be given should give the gift to brahmins who are masters of the threefold knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> “But how, brahmin, do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is a master of the threefold knowledge?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Here, Master Gotama, a brahmin is well born on both sides … <span class="add">as in 3:58</span> … and <span class="add">skilled</span> in the marks of a great man. It is in this way that the brahmins describe a master of the threefold knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Brahmin, a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline is quite different from the one that the brahmins describe.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“But in what way, Master Gotama, is one a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma in such a way as to make clear how one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Yes, sir,” the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Here, brahmin, secluded from sensual pleasures … <span class="add">all as in 3:58, down to:</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.167"></a> … This is the third true knowledge attained by him. Ignorance is dispelled, true knowledge has arisen; darkness is dispelled, light has arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“One consummate in virtue and observances,<br>
who is resolute and composed,<br>
whose mind has been mastered,<br>
one-pointed and well concentrated;<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“one who knows his past abodes,<br>
who sees heaven and the plane of misery,<br>
and has reached the destruction of birth<br>
is a sage consummate in direct knowledge. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.168"></a><br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>“Through these three kinds of knowledge<br>
one is a triple-knowledge brahmin.<br>
I call him a triple-knowledge master,<br>
not the other who utters incantations.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>“It is in this way, brahmin, that one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“A master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins. And a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>“Excellent, Master Gotama! … Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
