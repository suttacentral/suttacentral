<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The one without expectation, the one full of expectation, and the one who has overcome expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the person without expectation? Here, a person has been reborn in a low family—a family of caṇḍālas, bamboo workers, hunters, cart makers, or flower scavengers—one that is poor, with little food and drink, that subsists with difficulty, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly, unsightly, dwarfish, with much illness: blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting. He hears: ‘The khattiyas have anointed such and such a khattiya.’ It does not occur to him: ‘When will the khattiyas anoint me too?’ This is called the person without expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(2) “And what is the person full of expectation? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.108"></a> Here, the eldest son of a head-anointed khattiya king, one due to be anointed but not yet anointed, has attained the unshaken. He hears: ‘The khattiyas have anointed such and such a khattiya.’ It occurs to him: ‘When will the khattiyas anoint me too?’ This is called the person full of expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(3) “And what is the person who has overcome expectation? Here, a head-anointed khattiya king hears: ‘Such and such a khattiya has been anointed by the khattiyas.’ It does not occur to him: ‘When will the khattiyas anoint me too?’ For what reason? Because his past expectation of anointment subsided when he was anointed. This is called the person who has overcome expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“So too, bhikkhus, there are three kinds of persons found existing among the bhikkhus. What three? The one without expectation, the one full of expectation, and the one who has overcome expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the person without expectation? Here, some person is immoral, of bad character, of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. He hears: ‘Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.’ It does not occur to him: ‘When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?’ This is called the person without expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>(2) “And what is the person full of expectation? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character. He <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.109"></a> hears: ‘Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.’ It occurs to him: ‘When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?’ This is called the person full of expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>(3) “And what is the person who has overcome expectation? Here, a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed. He hears: ‘Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.’ It does not occur to him: ‘When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwell in it?’ For what reason? Because his past expectation of liberation subsided when he was liberated. This is called the person who has overcome expectation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing among the bhikkhus.”</p>
