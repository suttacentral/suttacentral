<h1>7. Devadatta’s Failing</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak not long after Devadatta had left. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus with reference to Devadatta:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings. It is good for him from time to time to review the failings of others. It is good for him from time to time to review his own achievements. It is good for him from time to time to review the achievements of others. Because he was over come and obsessed by eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. What eight?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“(1) Because he was overcome and obsessed by gain, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. (2) Because he was overcome and obsessed by loss … (3) … by fame … (4) … by disrepute … (5) … by honor … (6) … by lack of honor … (7) … by evil desires … (8) … by bad friendship, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. Because he was overcome and obsessed by these eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“It is good for a bhikkhu to overcome gain whenever it arises. It is good for him to overcome loss whenever it arises … to overcome fame … disrepute … honor <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.161"></a> … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“And for what reason should a bhikkhu overcome gain whenever it arises? For what reason should he overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises? Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen gain do not occur in one who has overcome it. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen loss … arisen fame … arisen disrepute … arisen honor … arisen lack of honor … arisen evil desires … arisen bad friendship do not occur in one who has overcome it. For this reason a bhikkhu should overcome gain whenever it arises. He should overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will overcome gain whenever it arises. We will overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.” <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.162"></a></p>
