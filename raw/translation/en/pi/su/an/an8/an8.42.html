<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. And how is the uposatha observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>(1) “Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple reflects thus: <em>‘</em>As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, they dwell compassionate toward all living beings. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, I too shall dwell compassionate toward all living beings. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.’ This is the first factor it possesses …</p>
<p><span class="add">As in 8:41 down to:</span> …</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>(8) “‘As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; they lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds; I shall lie down on a low resting place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.’ This is the eighth factor it possesses.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the uposatha is observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.252"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“To what extent is it of great fruit and benefit? To what extent is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive? Suppose one were to exercise sovereignty and kingship over these sixteen great countries abounding in the seven precious substances, that is, <span class="add">the countries of</span> the Aṅgans, the Magadhans, the Kāsis, the Kosalans, the Vajjis, the Mallas, the Cetis, the Vaṅgas, the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the Macchas, the Sūrasenas, the Assakas, the Avantis, the Gandhārans, and the Kambojans: this would not be worth a sixteenth part of the uposatha observance complete in those eight factors. For what reason? Because human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“For the devas <span class="add">ruled by</span> the four great kings, a single night and day is equivalent to fifty human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is five hundred such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the devas <span class="add">ruled by</span> the four great kings. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“For the Tāvatiṃsa devas, a single night and day is equivalent to a hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is a thousand such celestial years. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.253"></a> It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the Tāvatiṃsa devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“For the Yāma devas, a single night and day is equivalent to two hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is two thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the Yāma devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“For the Tusita devas, a single night and day is equivalent to four hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is four thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the Tusita devas. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“For the devas who delight in creation, a single night and day is equivalent to eight hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is eight thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.254"></a> who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the devas who delight in creation. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“For the devas who control what is created by others, a single night and day is equivalent to sixteen hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve such months make up a year. The life span of those devas is sixteen thousand such celestial years. It is possible, bhikkhus, for a woman or man who observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors, with the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in companionship with the devas who control what is created by others. It was with reference to this that I said human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>One should not kill living beings or take what is not given;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>one should not speak falsehood or drink intoxicants;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>one should refrain from sexual activity, from unchastity;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>one should not eat at night or at an improper time.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>One should not wear garlands or apply scents;<br>
one should sleep on a <span class="add">low</span> bed or a mat on the ground;<br>
this, they say, is the eight-factored uposatha<br>
proclaimed by the Buddha,<br>
who reached the end of suffering.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>As far as the sun and moon revolve,<br>
shedding light, so beautiful to gaze upon,<br>
dispellers of darkness, moving through the firmament,<br>
they shine in the sky, brightening up the quarters. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.255"></a><br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>Whatever wealth exists in this sphere—<br>
pearls, gems, and excellent beryl,<br>
horn gold and mountain gold,<br>
and the natural gold called <span class="italic">haṭaka</span>—<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>those are not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of an uposatha complete in the eight factors,<br>
just as all the hosts of stars<br><span class="add">do not match</span> the moon’s radiance.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a>Therefore a virtuous woman or man,<br>
having observed the uposatha complete in eight factors<br>
and having made merit productive of happiness,<br>
blameless goes to a heavenly state.<br></p>
