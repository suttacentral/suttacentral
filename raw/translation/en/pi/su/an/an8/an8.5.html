<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, these eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.157"></a> Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Gain and loss, disrepute and fame,<br>
blame and praise, pleasure and pain:<br>
these conditions that people meet<br>
are impermanent, transient, and subject to change.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>A wise and mindful person knows them<br>
and sees that they are subject to change.<br>
Desirable conditions don’t excite his mind<br>
nor is he repelled by undesirable conditions.<br></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>He has dispelled attraction and repulsion;<br>
they are gone and no longer present.<br>
Having known the dustless, sorrowless state,<br>
he understands rightly and has transcended existence.<br></p>
