<h1>15. Stains</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these eight stains. What eight? (1) Non-recitation is the stain of the hymns. (2) The stain of houses is lack of upkeep. (3) The stain of beauty is laziness. (4) Heedlessness is the stain of a guard. (5) A woman’s stain is misconduct. (6) Miserliness is a donor’s stain. (7) Bad unwholesome qualities are stains in this world and the next. (8) A stain graver than this is ignorance, the very worst of stains. These, bhikkhus, are the eight stains.”</p>
