<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One then said to him: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.224"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhante, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, he possesses eight powers by reason of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’ What eight?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>(1) “Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>(2) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pit. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>(3) “Again, the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion; it is withdrawn, delighting in renunciation, and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>(4) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness. Since <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.225"></a> that is so, this is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>(5)–(8) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four bases for psychic potency … the five spiritual faculties … the seven factors of enlightenment … the noble eightfold path. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Bhante, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, he possesses these eight powers on the basis of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’”</p>
