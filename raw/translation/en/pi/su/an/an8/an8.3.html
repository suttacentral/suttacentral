Here, (1) a bhikkhu praises those who are displeasing and (2) criticizes those who are pleasing; (3) he is desirous of gains and (4) honor; (5) he is morally shameless and (6) morally reckless; (7) he has evil desires and (8) holds wrong view. Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks and is neither respected nor esteemed by them.</p>
