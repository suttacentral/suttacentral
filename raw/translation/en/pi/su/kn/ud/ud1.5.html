<h1>The Discourse about the Elders</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Sāriputta, venerable Mahāmoggallāna, venerable Mahākassapa, venerable Mahākaccāyana, venerable Mahākoṭṭhita, venerable Mahākappina, venerable Mahācunda, venerable Anuruddha, venerable Revata, and venerable Nanda went to the Gracious One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>The Gracious One saw those venerable ones coming while still far away, and having seen <span class="add">them</span>, he addressed the monks <span class="add">saying</span>: “These brāhmaṇas are coming, monks; these brāhmaṇas are coming, monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>After that was said, a certain monk who was a brāhmaṇa by birth, said to the Gracious One: “To what extent, dear Gotama, is one a brāhmaṇa? And again what things make one a brāhmaṇa?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Those who, having removed bad things, live always mindful,<br>
The Buddhas who have destroyed the fetters,<br>
truly they are brāhmaṇas in the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
