<h1>The Discourse about the King</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time the Kosalan King Pasenadi had gone to the top of the royal palace with Queen Mallikā. Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to Queen Mallikā: “Is there anyone, Mallikā, you love more than yourself?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“There is no one, Great King, I love more than myself. But is there, Great King, anyone you love more than yourself?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“For me also, Mallikā, there is no one I love more than myself.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi having come down from the palace went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Here, reverend Sir, having gone to the top of the royal palace with Queen Mallikā I said this to Queen Mallikā: ‘Is there anyone, Mallikā, you love more than yourself?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>When that was said, Queen Mallikā said this to me: ‘There is no one, Great King, I love more than myself. But is there, Great King, anyone you love more than yourself?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>When that was said, reverend Sir, I said this to Queen Mallikā: ‘For me also, Mallikā, there is no one I love more than myself.’ ”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Having gone around in all directions with the mind,<br>
There is surely no one found who is loved more than oneself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“In the same way others each love themselves,<br>
Therefore one who cares for himself should not harm another.”</p>
</blockquote>
