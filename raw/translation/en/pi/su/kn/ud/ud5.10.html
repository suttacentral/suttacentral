<h1>The Discourse about Panthaka</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Cullapanthaka was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and attending to mindfulness at the front. The Gracious One saw venerable Cullapanthaka sat not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and attending to mindfulness at the front.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“With steady body, with steady mind,<br>
Whether standing, sitting, or lying down,<br>
The monk who is thus determined on mindfulness,<br>
Can gain the earlier and following distinction<span class="add">s</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Having gained the earlier and following distinction<span class="add">s</span>,<br>
He can go beyond sight of the King of Death.”</p>
