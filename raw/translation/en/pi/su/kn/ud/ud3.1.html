<h1>The Discourse about Deeds</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then at that time a certain monk was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, and after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, he was bearing painful, sharp, harsh, and bitter feelings, that had arisen as a result of former <span class="add">unwholesome</span> deeds, mindfully, with full awareness, and without being troubled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>The Gracious One saw that monk sitting not far away, who after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, was bearing painful, sharp, harsh, and severe feelings, that had arisen as a result of former <span class="add">unwholesome</span> deeds, mindfully, with full awareness, and without being troubled. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“For the monk who has given up all deeds,<br>
For he who is throwing off the dust of what was done before,<br>
For he who is unselfish, stable, such-like,<br>
There is no need to speak to people.”</p>
</blockquote>
