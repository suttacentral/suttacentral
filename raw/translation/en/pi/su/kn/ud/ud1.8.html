<h1>The Discourse about Saṅgāmajī</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Gracious One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife heard: “Master Saṅgāmajī it seems has arrived at Sāvatthī”, and taking her little boy she went to Jeta’s Wood.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī was dwelling for the day sat at the root of a certain tree. Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife went to venerable Saṅgāmajī, and after going, she said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>After that was said, venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>For a second time venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p>For a second time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p>For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife, having put the boy down in front of venerable Saṅgāmajī, went away, <span class="add">saying</span>: “This is your son, ascetic, you must take care of him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>But venerable Saṅgāmajī did not look at the boy, nor did he speak <span class="add">to him</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife having gone not far away, looking round saw that venerable Saṅgāmajī was neither looking at the boy, nor was he speaking <span class="add">to him</span>. Having seen <span class="add">that</span> this occured to her: “This ascetic does not even have need of a son.” Therefore, after turning back and taking the boy, she went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>The Gracious One saw with the divine-eye which is purified, and surpasses that of <span class="add">normal</span> men, that venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife had such bad manners. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>“In <span class="add">her</span> coming he does not rejoice, in <span class="add">her</span> leaving he does not grieve,<br>
Saṅgāmajī ‘Victorious in Battle’, free from the shackle: him I call a brāhmaṇa.”</p>
</blockquote>
