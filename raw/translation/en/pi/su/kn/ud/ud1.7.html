<h1>The Discourse about Pāvā</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Pāvā, near the Flock of Goats Shrine, at the domicile of the Flock of Goats yakkha. Then at that time the Gracious One, in the darkness of the night, was sitting in the open air, and the sky-god was raining lightly drop by drop.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then the Flock of Goats yakkha desiring to give rise to fear, terror, and horror in the Gracious One, went to the Gracious One, and after going, not far away from the Gracious One three times <span class="add">he called out</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Confusion, great confusion”, and he made a great confusion, “This is a demon for you, ascetic!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“He is a brāhmaṇa when he has gone beyond in regard to his own things,<br>
Then has he transcended this demon and the great confusion.”</p>
</blockquote>
