<h1>The Discourse about the One Short-Lived</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then venerable Ānanda, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, just how short-lived, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s mother was, seven days after the Gracious One was born, the Gracious One’s mother died, and arose among the Tusita hosts.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“It is just so, Ānanda, the mothers of Awakening-Ones are indeed short-lived, seven days after the Awakening-Ones are born, the mothers of Awakening-Ones die, and arise among the Tusita hosts.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Whatsoever beings there are, or [ever] will be,<br>
They will all go on after giving up the body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“The one who is skilful, having understood all that deprivation,<br>
Should live the spiritual life ardently.”</p>
</blockquote>
