<h1>The Discourse on the Treasures</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Whatever beings have come together here,<br>
whether of the earth or in the firmament,<br>
may the minds of all those beings be happy,<br>
and may they listen carefully to what is said.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Therefore, all of you beings, be attentive,<br>
be friendly towards this generation of men,<br>
they who bring offerings by day and by night,<br>
as they are heedful please protect them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>Whatever riches there are—here or hereafter<br>
or in the heavens—that excellent treasure<br>
is not equal unto the Realised One—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Buddha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><span class="add">Craving’s</span> end, dispassion, deathlessness, excellence—<br>
that which the concentrated Sakyan sage attained—<br>
there is nothing that is equal to the Dhamma—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Dhamma:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>That which the great Buddha praised as being pure—<br>
the concentration said to have immediate <span class="add">result</span>—<br>
no equal to that concentration is found—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Dhamma:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>Those eight individuals praised by the good—<br>
there are these four pairs <span class="add">of persons</span>—<br>
those disciples of the Fortunate One are worthy of gifts,<br>
those things that have been given to them have great fruit—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Those who have firm minds that are devoted to<br>
Gotama’s teaching, being free from sense desire—<br>
having attained and entered the deathless—<br>
are enjoying the stillness, obtained for free—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Just as a locking post stuck fast in the earth<br>
does not waver on account of the four winds,<br>
just like this, I say, is the person who is true,<br>
the one who sees the noble truths completely—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>Those who clearly distinguish the noble truths,<br>
which have been well preached by the one with great wisdom,<br>
no matter how great they become in heedlessness<br>
still they do not take up an eighth existence—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>Together with his attainment of seeing <span class="add">Emancipation</span><br>
there are three things that are given up:<br>
embodiment view, uncertainty, and<br>
whatever <span class="add">grasping at</span> virtue and practices there is.<br>
He is free from <span class="add">rebirth in</span> the four lower worlds,<br>
and he is incapable of the six great crimes—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>Whatever bad actions he performs<br>
by way of body, speech, or mind,<br>
he is incapable of covering it up:<br>
this incapacity is said of one who has seen the state <span class="add">of peace</span>—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>Just like a tall woodland tree crowned with flowers<br>
in the summer months, in the early summer,<br>
just like this he preached the Dhamma which is best,<br>
which goes to Emancipation, the highest benefit—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Buddha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>The best one, knowing the best, gave the best, brought the best,<br>
he preached the best Dhamma, which is unsurpassed—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Buddha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>The old is destroyed, and nothing new is produced,<br>
their minds are unexcited by future rebirth,<br>
they have destroyed the seeds, and have no desire for growth,<br>
the wise are still, just as this lamp <span class="add">is still</span>—<br>
this excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<br>
by virtue of this truth may there be safety!</p>

<p><span class="add">Spoken by Sakka, lord of the gods:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a>Whatever beings have come together here,<br>
whether of the earth or in the firmament,<br>
we <span class="add">all</span> revere the realised Buddha who is<br>
honoured by gods and men—may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>Whatever beings have come together here,<br>
whether of the earth or in the firmament,<br>
we <span class="add">all</span> revere the realised Dhamma which is<br>
honoured by gods and men—may there be safety!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a>Whatever beings have come together here,<br>
whether of the earth or in the firmament,<br>
we <span class="add">all</span> revere the realised Sangha which is<br>
honoured by gods and men—may there be safety!</p>
