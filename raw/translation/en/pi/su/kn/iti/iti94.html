<h1>94. Investigating</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should so investigate that as he investigates, his consciousness is not distracted and diffused externally, and internally is not fixed, and by not grasping anything he should remain undisturbed. If his consciousness is not distracted and diffused externally, and internally is not fixed, and if by not grasping anything he remains undisturbed, then there is no coming into existence of birth, ageing, death, and suffering in the future.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>When a bhikkhu has abandoned<br>
The seven ties and cut the cord,<br>
His wandering on in births is finished:<br>
There is no renewal of being for him.</p>
