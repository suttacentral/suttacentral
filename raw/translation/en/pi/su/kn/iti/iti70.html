<h1>70. Wrong View</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who practise misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who vilify the noble ones, who hold wrong view and perform various deeds because of their wrong view. When the body perishes, those beings are reborn after death in a state of misery, a bad bourn, a state of ruin, in hell. I say this, bhikkhus, without having learnt it from another recluse or brahmin. It is just because I myself have known it, seen it, and observed it that I say: ‘Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who practise misconduct by body, speech, and mind … reborn after death in a state of misery … in hell.’”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>An individual here with<br>
A wrongly directed mind<br>
Who utters wrong speech<br>
And performs wrong deeds,<br>
One of little learning,<br>
Who does demerit in this short life—<br>
Upon the perishing of the body<br>
That foolish one is reborn in hell.</p>
