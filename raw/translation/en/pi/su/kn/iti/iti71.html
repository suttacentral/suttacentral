<h1>71. Right View</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who practise good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who do not vilify the noble ones, who hold right view and perform various deeds because of their right view. When the body perishes, those beings are reborn after death in a good bourn, a heavenly world. I say this, bhikkhus, without having learnt it from another recluse or brahmin. It is just because I myself have known it, seen it, and observed it that I say: ‘Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who practise good conduct by body, speech, and mind … reborn after death in a good bourn, a heavenly world.’”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>An individual here with<br>
A rightly directed mind<br>
Who utters right speech<br>
And performs right deeds,<br>
One of much learning,<br>
Who does much merit in this short life—<br>
Upon the perishing of the body<br>
That wise one is reborn in heaven.</p>
