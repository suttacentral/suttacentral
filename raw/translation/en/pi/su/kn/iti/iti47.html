<h1>47. Vigilance</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should be vigilant; he should live mindful, clearly comprehending, concentrated, happy and calm, and should know when it is suitable to cultivate those things that are wholesome. Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu who is vigilant and living thus, one of two fruits is to be expected: final knowledge here and now or, there being some residual defilement, the state of non-returning.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>You vigilant ones hear this:<br>
Wake up, you who are asleep!<br>
Vigilance is better than sleep:<br>
There is no fear for the vigilant.</p>
<p>One who is vigilant and mindful,<br>
Comprehending and concentrated,<br>
Joyful and calm in his thoughts,<br>
By rightly investigating the Dhamma<br>
With unified mind, will in time<br>
Destroy the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore be devoted to vigilance,<br>
An ardent, discerning, meditative bhikkhu.<br>
Having severed the fetter of birth and decay,<br>
One may here and now attain<br>
Enlightenment which is supreme.</p>
