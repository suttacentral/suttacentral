<h1>81. Homage</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, I have seen beings, overwhelmed and with minds obsessed by receiving homage, upon the perishing of the body after death take rebirth in a state of misery, a bad bourn, a state of ruin, hell. I have seen beings, overwhelmed and with minds obsessed by not receiving homage … by both receiving homage and (later) not receiving homage, upon the perishing of the body after death take rebirth in a state of misery, a bad bourn, a state of ruin, hell.</p>
<p>“I say this, bhikkhus, without having learnt it from another recluse or brahmin… It is just because I myself have known it, seen it, and observed it, that I say: I have seen beings, overwhelmed and with minds obsessed by receiving homage … after death take rebirth in … hell.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>He is one who lives diligently<br>
With concentration undisturbed,<br>
Both when homage is paid to him<br>
And when he receives no homage.</p>
<p>Meditating continuously, gifted<br>
With subtle view and insight,<br>
Enjoying the destruction of grasping—<br>
They call such a one a “true man.”</p>
