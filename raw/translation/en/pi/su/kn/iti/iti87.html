<h1>87. Producing Blindness</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these three kinds of unwholesome thoughts produce blindness, lack of vision, and absence of knowledge; they obstruct wisdom, lead to vexation, and are not conducive to Nibbāna. What are the three? A sensual thought, a thought of ill will, and an aggressive thought. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of unwholesome thoughts that produce blindness&nbsp;… and are not conducive to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these three kinds of wholesome thoughts remove blindness and produce vision, knowledge, and the growth of wisdom; they do not lead to vexation and are conducive to Nibbāna. What are the three? A thought of renunciation, a thought of friendliness, and a thought of harmlessness. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of wholesome thoughts that remove blindness … and are conducive to Nibbāna.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Three wholesome thoughts should be entertained,<br>
Three unwholesome thoughts rejected.<br>
One who stops such trains of thought<br>
As a shower settles a cloud of dust,<br>
With a mind that has quelled such thoughts<br>
Attains in this life the state of peace.</p>
