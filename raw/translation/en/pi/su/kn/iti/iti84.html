<h1>84. For the Welfare of Many</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these three persons appearing in the world appear for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans. What three?</p>
<p>“Here, bhikkhus, a Tathāgata appears in the world, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One, possessing perfect knowledge and conduct, a sublime one, a world-knower, an unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, a teacher of devas and humans, an enlightened one, a Lord. He teaches Dhamma that is good at the outset, good in the middle, and good at the end, with its correct meaning and wording, and he proclaims the holy life in its fulfilment and complete purity. This, bhikkhus, is the first person appearing in the world who appears for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.</p>
<p>“Next, bhikkhus, there is a disciple of that teacher, an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, the holy life fulfilled, who has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained the goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely released through final knowledge. He teaches Dhamma … and he proclaims the holy life in its fulfilment and complete purity. This, bhikkhus, is the second person appearing in the world … for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.</p>
<p>“And next, bhikkhus, there is a disciple of that teacher, a learner who is following the path, who has learnt much and is of virtuous conduct. He teaches Dhamma … and he proclaims the holy life in its fulfilment and complete purity. This, bhikkhus, is the third person appearing in the world … for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.</p>
<p>“These, bhikkhus, are the three persons appearing in the world who appear for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>The teacher, the great sage,<br>
Is the first in the world;<br>
Following him is the disciple<br>
Whose composure is perfected;<br>
And then the learner training on the path,<br>
One who has learnt much and is virtuous.</p>
<p>These three are chief amongst devas and humans:<br>
Illuminators, preaching Dhamma,<br>
Opening the door to the Deathless,<br>
They free many people from bondage.</p>
<p>Those who follow the path<br>
Well taught by the unsurpassed<br>
Caravan-leader, who are diligent<br>
In the Sublime One’s dispensation,<br>
Make an end of suffering<br>
Within this very life itself.</p>
