<h1>20. A Corrupt Mind</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Here, bhikkhus, some person has a corrupt mind. Having examined his mind with my mind, I know that if this person were to die at this time, as if carried there he would be placed in hell. What is the reason for that? It is because his mind is corrupt. It is because of the mind’s corruption that some beings here, when the body perishes, are reborn after death in a state of misery, a bad bourn, a state of ruin, hell.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Understanding the corrupt mind<br>
Of some person dwelling here,<br>
The Buddha explained its meaning<br>
In the presence of the bhikkhus.</p>
<p>If that person were to die<br>
At this very moment now,<br>
He would be reborn in hell<br>
Because of his corrupt mind.</p>
<p>As if they were carried off<br>
And placed there, thus<br>
Beings go to a bad bourn<br>
Because of mind’s corruption.</p>
