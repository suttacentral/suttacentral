<p>This was said by the Lord, said by the Arahant, so I heard:</p>
<p>“Abandon one thing, bhikkhus, and I guarantee you non-returning. What is that one thing? Greed is that one thing, bhikkhus. Abandon that and I guarantee you non-returning.”</p>
<p>This is the meaning of what the Lord said. So in regard to this it was said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Beings coveting with greed<br>
Go to rebirth in a bad bourn.<br>
But having rightly understood greed,<br>
Those with insight abandon it.<br>
By abandoning it they never come<br>
Back to this world again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord, so I heard.</p>
