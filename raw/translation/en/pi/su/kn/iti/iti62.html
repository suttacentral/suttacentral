<h1>62. Faculties</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord …</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three faculties. What three? The faculty of the assurance: ‘I shall come to finally know what is as yet not finally known’; the faculty of final knowledge; and the faculty of one who has finally known. These, bhikkhus, are the three faculties.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>For a learner who is training<br>
In conformity with the direct path,<br>
The knowledge of destruction arises first,<br>
And final knowledge immediately follows.</p>
<p>Freed by that final knowledge,<br>
By destroying the fetters of being<br>
The serene one has the certainty:<br>
“Unshakeable is my release.”</p>
<p>Endowed with this faculty<br>
The peaceful one delights in the peaceful state.<br>
Having conquered Māra and his mount,<br>
He bears his final body.</p>
