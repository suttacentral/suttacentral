<h1>74. Sons</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these three kinds of sons are found existing in the world. What three? The superior kind, the similar kind, and the inferior kind.</p>
<p>“Now what, bhikkhus, is the superior kind of son? In this instance a son has a mother and father who have not gone for refuge to the Buddha, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha; who do not abstain from taking life, from taking what has not been given, from wrong conduct in sensual desires, from false speech, and from intoxicating drink leading to negligence;who are unvirtuous and of bad conduct. But the son is one who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha; who abstains from taking life, from taking what has not been given, from wrong conduct in sensual desires, from false speech, and from intoxicating drink leading to negligence; who is virtuous and of good conduct. This, bhikkhus, is the superior kind of son.</p>
<p>“Now what, bhikkhus, is the similar kind of son? In this instance a son has a mother and father who have gone for refuge to the Buddha … who abstain from taking life … who are virtuous and of good conduct. And the son also is one who has gone for refuge to the Buddha … who abstains from taking life … who is virtuous and of good conduct. This, bhikkhus, is the similar kind of son.</p>
<p>“Now what, bhikkhus, is the inferior kind of son? In this instance a son has a mother and father who have gone for refuge to the Buddha … who abstain from taking life … who are virtuous and of good conduct. But the son is one who has not gone for refuge to the Buddha … who does not abstain from taking life … who is unvirtuous and of bad conduct. This, bhikkhus, is the inferior kind of son.</p>
<p>“These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of sons found existing in the world.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>The wise wish for a son<br>
Who is superior or similar.<br>
They do not wish for an inferior son,<br>
One who disgraces the family.</p>
<p>But such sons in the world<br>
Who are devoted lay followers,<br>
Excelling in faith and virtue,<br>
Liberal, without selfishness,<br>
Shine forth in assemblies<br>
Like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
