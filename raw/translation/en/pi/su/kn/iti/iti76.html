<h1>76. Aspiring for Happiness</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, aspiring for these three kinds of happiness, a wise person should guard virtuous conduct. What are the three?</p>
<p>Aspiring ‘May praise come to me,’ a wise person should guard virtuous conduct. Aspiring ‘May I become wealthy,’ a wise person should guard virtuous conduct. Aspiring ‘Upon the perishing of the body at death may I be reborn in a good bourn, in a heavenly world,’ a wise person should guard virtuous conduct. These are the three kinds of happiness aspiring for which a wise person should guard virtuous conduct.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Aspiring for three kinds of happiness<br>
The wise person should guard virtue:<br>
Praise, the obtaining of property,<br>
Rejoicing in heaven hereafter.</p>
<p>If one who does no evil<br>
Associates with an evil-doer,<br>
He is suspected of evil<br>
And his disrepute grows.</p>
<p>Whatever person one befriends,<br>
Whomever one associates with,<br>
One becomes of like quality,<br>
One becomes like one’s companion.</p>
<p>The follower and the followed,<br>
One who contacts and one contacted,<br>
Are like an arrow coated with poison<br>
That contaminates its quiver.<br>
Fearing contamination the wise person<br>
Should not have evil friends.</p>
<p>A man who ties up putrid fish<br>
With some blades of kusa-grass<br>
Makes the kusa-grass smell putrid;<br>
So it is with those who follow fools.</p>
<p>But a man who wraps tagara powder<br>
In the broad leaf of a tree<br>
Makes the leaf smell fragrant;<br>
So it is with those who follow sages.</p>
<p>Therefore as with the leaf-container,<br>
Understanding the outcome for oneself,<br>
The unvirtuous should not be followed,<br>
A wise person should follow the virtuous.<br>
The unvirtuous lead one to hell,<br>
The virtuous help one reach heaven.</p>
