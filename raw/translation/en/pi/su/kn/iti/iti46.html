<h1>46. The Benefits of the Training</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, live so as to realize the benefits of the training, the attainment of higher wisdom, the essence of release, and the control of mindfulness. Bhikkhus, if you live to realize the benefits of the training … one of two fruits is to be expected: final knowledge here and now or, there being some residual defilement, the state of non-returning.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>One who has completed the training,<br>
Incapable of falling away,<br>
Attained to the higher wisdom,<br>
A seer of the end of birth—<br>
That sage bears his final body,<br>
And having left behind conceit,<br>
He has gone beyond decay, I say.</p>
<p>Therefore ever delighting in meditation,<br>
Concentrated, with ardent energy,<br>
Seeing the end of birth, O bhikkhus,<br>
Conquer Māra and his host,<br>
And go beyond all birth and death.</p>
</blockquote>
