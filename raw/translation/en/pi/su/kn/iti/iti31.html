<h1>31. Non-remorse</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“There are two things, bhikkhus, causing no remorse. What are the two? Here someone has done what is good, done what is wholesome, done what is beneficial, and has not done evil, callous, wrongful deeds. He is not remorseful on thinking, ‘I have done good,’ and is not remorseful on thinking, ‘I have done no evil.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things causing no remorse.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Having abandoned misconduct<br>
By body, misconduct by speech,<br>
Misconduct by mind, and whatever else<br>
Is reckoned a fault—</p>
<p>Not having done a bad deed<br>
And done much that is good—<br>
When his body perishes<br>
That wise one is reborn in heaven.</p>
