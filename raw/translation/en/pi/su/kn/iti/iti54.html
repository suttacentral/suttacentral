<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of search. What three? The search for sensual gratification, the search for being, and the search for a holy life. These are the three.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>
Concentrated, clearly comprehending<br>
And mindful, knows searches<br>
And the origin of searches,<br>
Where they cease and the path<br>
That leads to their full destruction.<br>
With the destruction of searches a bhikkhu,<br>
Without longing, has attained Nibbāna.</p>
