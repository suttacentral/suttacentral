<h1>63. Time</h1>

<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these are the three times. What three? Past time, future time, and present time. These, bhikkhus, are the three times.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Perceiving what can be expressed through concepts,<br>
Beings take their stand on what is expressed.<br>
Not fully understanding the expressed,<br>
They come under the bondage of Death.</p>
<p>But by fully understanding what is expressed<br>
One does not misconceive the speaker.<br>
His mind has attained to freedom,<br>
The unsurpassed state of peace.</p>
<p>Understanding what is expressed,<br>
The peaceful one delights in the peaceful state.<br>
Standing on Dhamma, perfect in knowledge,<br>
He freely makes use of concepts<br>
But no more enters into concept’s range.</p>
