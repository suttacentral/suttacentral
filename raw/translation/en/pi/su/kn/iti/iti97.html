<h1>97. Lovely Behaviour</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is of lovely behaviour, lovely nature, and lovely wisdom is called in this Dhamma-and-Discipline one who is fully accomplished, who has reached fulfil­ment, the supreme among humans.</p>
<p>“And how is a bhikkhu of lovely behaviour? Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous, he lives restrained by the restraint of the rules of discipline, endowed with perfect conduct and resort; seeing danger in the slightest faults, he undertakes the rules of training and trains in them. In this way a bhikkhu is one who is of lovely behaviour. Thus he is of lovely behaviour.</p>
<p>“And how is he of lovely nature? Here, a bhikkhu lives engaged in cultivating the seven groups of the requisites of enlight­enment. In this way a bhikkhu is one who is of lovely nature. Thus he is of lovely behaviour and lovely nature.</p>
<p>“And how is he of lovely wisdom? Here, through realization by his own direct knowledge, a bhikkhu here and now enters and abides in the mind-release and wisdom-release that is taintless by the destruction of the taints. In this way a bhikkhu is one who is of lovely wisdom.</p>
<p>“Thus he is of lovely behaviour, lovely nature, and lovely wisdom. In this Dhamma-and-Discipline he is called one who is fully accomplished, who has reached fulfilment and is supreme among humans.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>A conscientious bhikkhu<br>
Who never does wrong in any way,<br>
Neither by body, speech, or mind,<br>
Is called “one of lovely behaviour.”</p>
<p>An unassuming bhikkhu<br>
Who has cultivated well the states<br>
That lead to enlightenment<br>
Is called “one of lovely nature.”</p>
<p>A taintless bhikkhu<br>
Who understands for himself<br>
The end of suffering here<br>
Is called “one of lovely wisdom.”</p>
<p>He who excels in these three things,<br>
Untroubled, with doubt destroyed,<br>
Unattached in all the world,<br>
Is called “one who has abandoned all.”</p>
