<h1>95. Sensual Desire</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three ways of obtaining the objects of sensual desire. What three? There are those objects of sensual desire already existent; there is the way of those who delight in creating them; and there is the way of those who gain control over objects created by others. These are the three ways…”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Those who enjoy what exists,<br>
Those devas exercising control,<br>
Those who delight in creating,<br>
And others who enjoy sense-objects—<br>
Being in this state or another<br>
They cannot pass beyond saṃsāra.</p>
<p>Understanding this danger<br>
In objects of sensual enjoyment,<br>
Let the wise person abandon all sense pleasures,<br>
Those both heavenly and human.</p>
<p>By severing the flow of craving,<br>
The flow so difficult to overcome<br>
Of greed for pleasing, enticing forms,<br>
They attain to final Nibbāna<br>
And overcome all suffering.</p>
<p>The noble seers, masters of knowledge,<br>
Wise ones with perfect understanding,<br>
By directly knowing the end of birth<br>
Come no more to renewal of being.</p>
</blockquote>
