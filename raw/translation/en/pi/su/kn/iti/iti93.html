<h1>93. The Fires</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three fires. What three? The fire of lust, the fire of hate, and the fire of delusion. These, bhikkhus, are the three fires.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>The fire of lust burns mortals<br>
Infatuated by sensual pleasures;<br>
The fire of hate burns malevolent people<br>
Who kill other living beings;</p>
<p>The fire of delusion burns the bewildered,<br>
Ignorant of the Noble One’s Dhamma.<br>
Being unaware of these three fires,<br>
Humankind delights in personal existence.</p>
<p>Unfree from the bonds of Māra<br>
They swell the ranks of hell,<br>
Existence in the animal realm,<br>
Asura-demons and the sphere of ghosts.</p>
<p>But those engaged in practising<br>
The Buddha’s teaching day and night<br>
Ever perceiving the body’s foulness,<br>
Extinguish the fire of lust.</p>
<p>Those best of humans by loving-kindness<br>
Extinguish the fire of hate,<br>
And they extinguish the fire of delusion<br>
By wisdom that leads to penetration.</p>
<p>Having extinguished these fires,<br>
Unwearied night and day,<br>
Those discerning ones attain Nibbāna<br>
And overcome all suffering.</p>
<p>The noble seers, masters of knowledge,<br>
Wise ones with perfect understanding,<br>
By directly knowing the end of birth<br>
Come no more to renewal of being.</p>
