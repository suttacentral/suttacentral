<h1>6. Conceit</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“… Conceit is that one thing, bhikkhus. Abandon that and I guarantee you non-returning.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Beings puffed up with conceit<br>
Go to rebirth in a bad bourn.<br>
But having rightly understood conceit,<br>
Those with insight abandon it.<br>
By abandoning it they never come<br>
Back to this world again.</p>
