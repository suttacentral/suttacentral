<h1>27. The Development of Loving-kindness</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness. The mind-release of loving-kindness surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant.</p>
<p>“Just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance, but the moon’s radiance surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness…</p>
<p>“Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when the sky is clear and free of clouds, the sun, on ascending, dispels the darkness of space and shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness…</p>
<p>“And just as in the night, at the moment of dawn, the morning star shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the mind-release of loving-kindness. The mind-release of loving-kindness surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>For one who mindfully develops<br>
Boundless loving-kindness<br>
Seeing the destruction of clinging,<br>
The fetters are worn away.</p>
<p>If with an uncorrupted mind<br>
He pervades just one being<br>
With loving kindly thoughts,<br>
He makes some merit thereby.</p>
<p>But a noble one produces<br>
An abundance of merit<br>
By having a compassionate mind<br>
Towards all living beings.</p>
<p>Those royal seers who conquered<br>
The earth crowded with beings<br>
Went about performing sacrifices:<br>
The horse sacrifice, the man sacrifice,<br>
The water rites, the soma sacrifice,<br>
And that called “the Unobstructed.”</p>
<p>But these do not share even a sixteenth part<br>
Of a well cultivated mind of love,<br>
Just as the entire starry host<br>
Is dimmed by the moon’s radiance.</p>
<p>One who does not kill<br>
Nor cause others to kill,<br>
Who does not conquer<br>
Nor cause others to conquer,<br>
Kindly towards all beings—<br>
He has enmity for none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This too is the meaning of what was said by the Lord, so I heard.</p>
