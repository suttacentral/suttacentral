<h1>89. Devadatta</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, overcome with his mind obsessed by three kinds of wickedness, Devadatta will inevitably go to a state of misery, to hell, for the duration of the aeon. What are the three? Overcome with his mind obsessed by evil desires …; overcome with his mind obsessed by evil friends …; and although there was more that should have been done, he stopped halfway through gaining a trifling attainment of distinction. These, bhikkhus, are the three.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Surely no one of evil desires<br>
Is born again into this world.<br>
Know that he goes to the bourn of those<br>
Who live in the grip of evil desires.</p>
<p>I heard how Devadatta was<br>
Regarded as a wise man,<br>
One developed in meditation<br>
Who shone as it were with fame.</p>
<p>Having thought himself his equal,<br>
He assaulted the Tathāgata<br>
And went to the four-doored frightful place,<br>
Avīci the Unremitting Hell.</p>
<p>When one plots against an innocent<br>
Who has done no evil deed,<br>
That evil merely affects the one<br>
Corrupt of mind and disrespectful.</p>
<p>One who thinks he could pollute<br>
The ocean with a pot of poison<br>
Would not be able to pollute it—<br>
Awesome is that mass of water.</p>
<p>It is similar in attacking with abuse<br>
The Tathāgata who has reached perfection<br>
And ever dwells with peaceful mind—<br>
Abuse has no effect on him.</p>
<p>A wise man should befriend such a one<br>
And constantly follow after him.<br>
A bhikkhu who goes along his path<br>
Can reach the end of suffering.</p>
