<h1>7. Understanding the All</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, one who has not directly known and fully understood the ‘All,’who has not detached his mind from it and abandoned it, is incapable of destroying suffering. But one who has directly known and fully understood the ‘All,’ and who has detached his mind from it and abandoned it, is capable of destroying suffering.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>One who knows the “All” in every way,<br>
Who is not attached to anything,<br>
Having fully understood the “All,”<br>
Has overcome all suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
