<h1>106. With Brahmā</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Living with Brahmā are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. Living with the early devas are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. Living with the early teachers are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. Living with those worthy of adoration are those families where, within the home, mother and father are respected by their children. ‘Brahmā,’ bhikkhus, is a term for mother and father. ‘Early devas’ and ‘early teachers’ and ‘those worthy of veneration’ are terms for mother and father. For what reason? Because mother and father are very helpful to their children, they take care of them and bring them up and teach them about the world.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Mother and father are called<br>
“Brahmā,” “early teachers”<br>
And “worthy of veneration,”<br>
Being compassionate towards<br>
Their family of children.</p>
<p>Thus the wise should venerate them,<br>
Pay them due honour,<br>
Provide them with food and drink,<br>
Give them clothing and a bed,<br>
Anoint and bathe them<br>
And also wash their feet.</p>
<p>When he performs such service<br>
For his mother and his father,<br>
They praise that wise person even here<br>
And hereafter he rejoices in heaven.</p>
