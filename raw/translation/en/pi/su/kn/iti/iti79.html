<h1>79. Falling Away</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Three things, bhikkhus, lead to the falling away of a learner bhikkhu. What are the three? Here, a learner bhikkhu enjoys activity, is fond of activity, enjoys indulging in activity. He enjoys gossip, is fond of gossip, enjoys indulging in gossip. He enjoys sleep, is fond of sleep, enjoys indulging in sleep. These are the three things that lead to the falling away of a learner bhikkhu.</p>
<p>“Three things, bhikkhus, protect a learner bhikkhu from falling away. What are the three? Here, a learner bhikkhu does not enjoy activity, is not fond of activity, does not enjoy indulging in activity. He does not enjoy gossip, is not fond of gossip, does not enjoy indulging in gossip. He does not enjoy sleep, is not fond of sleep, does not enjoy indulging in sleep. These are the three things that protect a learner bhikkhu from falling away.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>A bhikkhu who enjoys activity,<br>
Restless, fond of gossip and sleep,<br>
Will never be able to attain<br>
Enlightenment which is supreme.</p>
<p>Thus let him restrict his duties,<br>
Give up sloth and restlessness;<br>
Such a bhikkhu can attain<br>
Enlightenment which is supreme.</p>
