<h1>88. Inner Stains</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these three are inner stains, inner enemies, inner foes, inner murderers, inner adversaries. What three? Greed, bhikkhus, is an inner stain … an inner adversary. Hate is an inner stain … an inner adversary. Delusion is an inner stain … an inner adversary. These are the three.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Greed is a cause of misfortune,<br>
Greed agitates the mind;<br>
People do not understand this<br>
As a danger produced within.</p>
<p>A greedy person does not know the good,<br>
A greedy person does not see the Dhamma;<br>
Blinding darkness then prevails<br>
When greed overwhelms a person.</p>
<p>But one who has abandoned greed<br>
Longs not for what invites cupidity.<br>
Greed slips away from him<br>
As a water drop from a lotus leaf.</p>
<p>Hate is a cause of misfortune,<br>
Hate agitates the mind;<br>
People do not understand this<br>
As a danger produced within.</p>
<p>A hater does not know the good,<br>
A hater does not see the Dhamma;<br>
Blinding darkness then prevails<br>
When hate overwhelms a person.</p>
<p>But one who has abandoned hate<br>
Is not angered by what incites to anger.<br>
Hate drops away from him<br>
As a palmyra fruit from its stalk.</p>
<p>Delusion is a cause of misfortune,<br>
Delusion agitates the mind;<br>
People do not understand this<br>
As a danger produced within.</p>
<p>One deluded does not know the good,<br>
One deluded does not see the Dhamma;<br>
Blinding darkness then prevails<br>
When delusion overwhelms a person.</p>
<p>But one who has abandoned delusion<br>
Is not bewildered by confusing things.<br>
He puts an end to all delusion<br>
As the sunrise dispels the dark.</p>
