<h1>44. The Nibbāna-element</h1>
</div>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these two Nibbāna-elements. What are the two? The Nibbāna-element with residue left and the Nibbāna-element with no residue left.</p>
<p>“What, bhikkhus, is the Nibbāna-element with residue left? Here a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, the holy life fulfilled, who has done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained the goal, destroyed the fetters of being, completely released through final knowledge. However, his five sense faculties remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable and feels pleasure and pain. It is the extinction of attachment, hate, and delusion in him that is called the Nibbāna-element with residue left.</p>
<p>“Now what, bhikkhus, is the Nibbāna-element with no residue left? Here a bhikkhu is an arahant … completely released through final knowledge. For him, here in this very life, all that is experienced, not being delighted in, will be extinguished. That, bhikkhus, is called the Nibbāna-element with no residue left.</p>
<p>“These, bhikkhus, are the two Nibbāna-elements.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>These two Nibbāna-elements were made known<br>
By the Seeing One, stableand unattached:<br>
One is the element seen here and now<br>
With residue, but with the cord of being destroyed;<br>
The other, having no residue for the future,<br>
Is that wherein all modes of being utterly cease.</p>
<p>Having understood the unconditioned state,<br>
Released in mind with the cord of being destroyed,<br>
They have attained to the Dhamma-essence.<br>
Delighting in the destruction (of craving),<br>
Those stable ones have abandoned all being.</p>
