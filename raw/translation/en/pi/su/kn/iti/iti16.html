<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, in regard to internal factors, I do not perceive another single factor so helpful as wise attentionfor a bhikkhu who is a learner, who has not attained perfection but lives aspiring for the supreme security from bondage. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who wisely attends abandons what is unwholesome and develops what is wholesome.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>For a bhikkhu who is a learner<br>
There is no other thing so helpful<br>
For reaching the highest goal<br>
As the factor wise attention.<br>
Wisely striving a bhikkhu may attain<br>
The destruction of all suffering.</p>
