<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc803"></a>Whoever should take to himself certain views,<br>
thinking them best, supreme in the world,<br>
and hence he proclaims all others as low—<br>
by this he does not become free from disputes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc804"></a>In whatever is seen by him, heard, and cognized,<br>
vows and rites done—he sees profit in these;<br>
and so from his grasping at that very view<br>
all others he sees as worthless, as low.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc805"></a>Intelligent people declare it a bond,<br>
if relying on one he sees others as low;<br>
therefore should a bhikkhu rely not on rites,<br>
on vows, on the seen, the heard, and cognized.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc806"></a>And so in this world let him fashion no views<br>
relying on knowledge, rites and vows done,<br>
nor let him conceive that he’s on a par,<br>
nor think himself low, nor higher than them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc807"></a>Abandoning own views, not grasping (at more)<br>
and even in knowledge not seeking support,<br>
’mong those who dispute he never takes sides,<br>
to the various views he does not recourse.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc808"></a>Having no bias for either extreme—<br>
for being, or not, here, the next world,<br>
for a bhikkhu like this there’s no settling down,<br>
’mong dharmas seized and decided (by them).</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc809"></a>Concerning the seen, the heard and cognized,<br>
not the least notion is fashioned by him,<br>
that one who’s perfected grasps at no view,<br>
by whom in the world could he be described?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc810"></a>Neither they’re fashioned nor honoured at all—<br>
those doctrines, they’re never accepted by him:<br>
Perfected, not guided by rites or by vows,<br>
One Thus, not returning, beyond has he gone.</p>
