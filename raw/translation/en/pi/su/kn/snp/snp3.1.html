<h1>3.1. The Leaving Home of Gotama</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc408"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
Now I’ll tell of the Leaving Home,<br>
how he, the mighty seer, went forth,<br>
how he was questioned and described<br>
the reason for his Leaving Home.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc409"></a>The crowded life lived in a house<br>
exhales an atmosphere of dust:<br>
but leaving home is open wide—<br>
seeing this, he chose Leaving Home.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc410"></a>By doing so did he reject<br>
all bodily evil acts,<br>
rejected too, wrong ways of speech,<br>
his livelihood he purified.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc411"></a>He went to Rājagaha town,<br>
hill-guarded fort of Magadhans;<br>
there he, the Buddha, walked for alms,<br>
with many a mark of excellence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc412"></a>King Bimbisāra from within<br>
his palace saw him passing by,<br>
and when he saw such excellence<br>
in all his marks,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc413"></a><span class="speaker">Bimbisāra</span><br>
“Look, sirs”, he said,<br>
How stately is that man, handsome,<br>
how pure, how perfect is his gait;<br>
with eyes downcast, mindful, he looks<br>
only a plough-yoke’s length ahead.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc414"></a>He’s surely not of humble birth!<br>
Send forth royal messengers at once<br>
upon the path the bhikkhu takes.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc415"></a><span class="speaker">Messenger</span><br>
The messengers were sent at once<br>
and followed closely in his wake:<br>
“Now which way will the bhikkhu go?<br>
Where has he chosen his abode?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc416"></a>He wanders on from house to house<br>
guarding sense-doors with real restraint.<br>
Fully aware and mindfully,<br>
his alms bowl soon was full.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc417"></a>His almsround is now done. The Sage<br>
is setting out and leaving town,<br>
taking the road to Paṇḍava—<br>
he must be living on its hill.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc418"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
Now when he came to his abode<br>
the messengers went up to him;<br>
though one of them turned back again<br>
to give the King reply:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc419"></a><span class="speaker">Messenger</span><br>
The bhikkhu, sire, is like a lion,<br>
or like a tiger, like a bull<br>
and seated in a mountain-cave<br>
on the eastern slope of Paṇḍava!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc420"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
The Warrior hears the runner’s tale,<br>
then summoning up a coach of state,<br>
he drove in haste from out the town,<br>
out to the hill of Paṇḍava.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc421"></a>He drove as far as he could go,<br>
and then descended from the coach;<br>
the little distance that remained,<br>
he went on foot, drew near the Sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc422"></a>The King sat down, and he exchanged<br>
greetings, and asked about his health.<br>
When this exchange of courtesy was done,<br>
the king then spoke to him these words:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc423"></a><span class="speaker">Bimbisāra</span><br>
You are indeed quite young,<br>
a youth, a man in life’s first phase,<br>
you have the good looks of a man<br>
of high-born warrior-noble stock,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc424"></a>one ﬁt to grace a first-rate force,<br>
to lead the troops of elephants,<br>
wealth can I give you to enjoy;<br>
please tell me of your birth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc425"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Straight over there, O king,<br>
the Himalayas can be seen,<br>
there, with wealth and energy,<br>
living among the Kosalans</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc426"></a>are the Ādicca of solar race,<br>
in that, the clan of Sakyas.<br>
From that family I’ve left home<br>
not desiring pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc427"></a>Having seen dangers in sense-desires,<br>
renunciation seen as secure,<br>
I shall go on to strive<br>
for there does my mind delight</p>
