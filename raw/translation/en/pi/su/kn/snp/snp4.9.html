<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc842"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
As Craving with Longing and Lust had been Seen<br>
no spark of desire existed for sex,<br>
What then about this filled with piss and with shit—<br>
That even with foot I’d not wish to touch!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc843"></a><span class="speaker">Māgandiya</span><br>
If you don’t wish for a jewel such as this,<br>
a woman desired by many lords of men,<br>
what view do you hold, living by what rite,<br>
by what vows to arise in what kind of life?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc844"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
As nothing is grasped among various Dharmas,<br>
so for me there is not any “This I proclaim”,<br>
having seen but not grasped among many views,<br>
through discernment among them I saw inner peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc845"></a><span class="speaker">Māgandiya</span><br>
Among what’s constructed thoroughly knowing,<br>
Ungrasping, O Sage, do you speak upon these,<br>
“inward peacefulness”—what meaning has that,<br>
how will the wise declare it to be?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc846"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Neither from views, not from learning or knowledge,<br>
not from rites, or from vows, does purity come I say;<br>
nor from no views, no learning, no knowledge acquired,<br>
no rites and no vows—none of them at all,<br>
Neither by grasping nor giving them up<br>
is their peace unsupported, and no hunger “to be”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc847"></a><span class="speaker">Māgandiya</span><br>
If you speak then not of purity by views,<br>
not by learning, not by knowledge, not rites and not vows;<br>
nor from no views, no learning, no knowledge acquired,<br>
by no rites and no vows—none of them at all,<br>
then I think that this is very deluded Dharma,<br>
for some depend on views as the source of purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc848"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Questioning repeatedly dependent on views,<br>
grasped at again, you’ve arrived at delusion,<br>
not having experienced even a tiny perception of peace,<br>
so therefore you see this as very deluded.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc849"></a>Who as “equal” considers, “greater” or “less”,<br>
conceiving others thus would dispute because of this;<br>
but who by these three never is swayed,<br>
“equal”, “superior” does not exist.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc850"></a>Why would this Brahmin declare “this is the true”,<br>
with whom would he argue that “this is false”,<br>
in whom there is not “equal”, “unequal”,<br>
with whom would he join another in dispute?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc851"></a>With home let go, faring on in homelessness,<br>
in villages the Sage having no intimates,<br>
rid of sensual desires, having no preference,<br>
would not with any arguments people engage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc852"></a>Unattached, one wanders forth in the world,<br>
a Nāga, ungrasping, would not dispute those,<br>
just as the water lily, thorny-stemmed species,<br>
sullied is not by water or mud,<br>
even so is the ungreedy Sage proclaiming Peace,<br>
unsullied by desires and pleasures in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc853"></a>The Wise One’s not conceited by view or by intelligence,<br>
for that one there is no “making-it-mine”;<br>
and cannot be led by good works or by learning,<br>
cannot be led away by mind-shelters of view.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc854"></a>For one detached from perception, there exist no ties,<br>
for one by wisdom freed, no delusions are there,<br>
but those who have grasped perceptions and views,<br>
they wander the world stirring up strife.</p>
