Not seen before by me,<br>
nor heard by anyone:<br>
such sweetly-spoken Teacher<br>
from Tusita came to lead a group.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc963"></a>One by himself attained to bliss,<br>
all darkness he dispelled,<br>
so that the One-With-Eyes be seen<br>
by world together with the gods.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc964"></a>One’s who’s “Thus”, the unattached,<br>
that Buddha undeceptive,<br>
with many disciples, devotees,<br>
for them I ask a question.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc965"></a>For a monk avoiding society,<br>
seeking out a lonely place—<br>
bone yards, at the base of trees,<br>
or caves within the mountain wastes—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc966"></a>Living-places high or low,<br>
How many are the terrors there,<br>
that a monk in his silent place<br>
trembles not at all?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc967"></a>How many are the troubles here<br>
for a monk to overcome,<br>
while living in a place remote,<br>
or going to the Ungone-Point.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc968"></a>What ways of speaking would be his?<br>
What place should he frequent?<br>
What sorts of rules, kinds of vows,<br>
For the monk with mind intent?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc969"></a>What is the training he adopts,<br>
one-pointed, mindful, wise;<br>
to blow away all blemishes,<br>
as does a smith with silver?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc970"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
As One who Knows I’ll explain to you,<br>
what’s pleasant for you practicing avoidance,<br>
who live and who rest in a lonely abode,<br>
wishing Awakening in keeping with Dharma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc971"></a>Within limits the mindful monk practices,<br>
then of five fears is this wise one not afraid:<br>
March-flies and mosquitoes, of slithering snakes,<br>
of men’s assaults, and fierce four-footed beasts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc972"></a>Nor be disturbed by those with differing Dharma,<br>
even having seen their many perils,<br>
further then, this seeker of the good<br>
will overcome all fearfulness too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc973"></a>Afflicted by sicknesses, hunger as well,<br>
the cold and strong heat he should endure,<br>
by these many touches should he be unmoved,<br>
having energy stirred and striving with strength.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc974"></a>Neither should he steal, nor should he tell lies,<br>
but let love suffuse the fearful and the unafraid,<br>
and when his mind is agitated let him know<br>
“This should be removed”—it’s on the Dark One’s side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc975"></a>Into the power of anger and of arrogance<br>
he shouldn’t fall, but firm, eradicate their roots,<br>
all being attached he overcomes complete,<br>
all that is dear to him, all that repels.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc976"></a>With wisdom esteemed, with joy purified,<br>
removing supports for all fearfulnesses,<br>
let him conquer dislike for his lone lodging-place,<br>
and conquer the four that cause him to lament:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc977"></a>“Alas, what shall I eat” and “where indeed eat it”,<br>
“last night l slept badly” and “where sleep today”—<br>
one-in-training, a wanderer, of no flag the follower<br>
should such thoughts let go, leading to lamentation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc978"></a>Satisfied, receiving timely food and clothes,<br>
knowing moderation in them, and<br>
protected by them, in a village he’s restrained<br>
though roughly he’s addressed, speaks no harsh word.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc979"></a>With eyes cast down, feet not longing-guided,<br>
to <i>jhāna</i> devoted, very watchful he should be,<br>
let him grow in equanimity with mind composed,<br>
check his scruples, how he inclines to doubt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc980"></a>With words of reproof let the mindful one rejoice,<br>
and shatter his scorn for his fellow-celibates;<br>
and utter skilful words at the proper time,<br>
and think not upon views and beliefs of common folk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc981"></a>And then in the world, there are the dusty five<br>
in which the mindful one guided, trains himself well,<br>
lust overcoming to bodies and to sounds,<br>
to tastes, to perfumes and touches too.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc982"></a>And when in these things he has guided desire,<br>
mindful, that bhikkhu of a well-liberated mind,<br>
then he in due time thoroughly examining Dharma,<br>
with mind become one he shall the darkness rend.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a>Thus the Master spoke.</p>
