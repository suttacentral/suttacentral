<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc256"></a>Though this person says “I am your friend”,<br>
nothing’s done for you as comrade would,<br>
but bereft of conscience, e’en despising you:<br>
as “not one of mine” this person should be known.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc257"></a>Who uses pleasant words to friends<br>
but does not act accordingly,<br>
wise people understand like this:<br>
“a speaker not a doer.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc258"></a>That one’s no friend who diligently<br>
seeks your faults, desiring strife;<br>
but with whom one rests, as child on breast,<br>
is friend indeed who none can part.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc259"></a>One who causes states of joy,<br>
who brings praiseworthy happiness,<br>
who’s grown the Fruits’ advantages,<br>
the human burden bears.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc260"></a>Having drunk of solitude<br>
and tasted Peace sublime,<br>
free from sorrow, evil-free,<br>
one savour: Dharma’s joy.</p>
