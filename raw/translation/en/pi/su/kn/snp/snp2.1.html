<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc224"></a>Whatever beings are assembled here,<br>
creatures of earth or spirits of the sky,<br>
may they be happy-minded, every one,<br>
and pay good heed to what is said to them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc225"></a>Hence, all ye spirits, hear attentively,<br>
look lovingly upon the human race,<br>
and, since they bring you offerings day and night,<br>
keep watch and ward about them heedfully.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc226"></a>The riches of this world and of the next<br>
and all precious things the heavens may hold,<br>
none can compare with the Tathāgata.<br>
Yea, in the Buddha shines this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc227"></a>The waning out of lust, that wondrous state<br>
of Deathlessness the Sakyan Sage attained<br>
through calm and concentration of the mind—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc228"></a>nothing with that state can ought compare.<br>
Yea, in the Dharma shines this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc229"></a>That flawless meditation praised by Him<br>
who is the wisest of the wise, which brings<br>
instant reward to one who practises—<br>
naught with this meditation can compare.<br>
Yea, in the Dharma shines this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc230"></a>Those Persons Eight who all the sages praise,<br>
make up four pairs. Worthy of offerings<br>
are they, the followers of the Happy one,<br>
and offerings made bear abundant fruit.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha shines this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc231"></a>Whoso, desireless, have applied themselves<br>
ﬁrm-minded to the love of Gotama,<br>
reached to the goal, plunged into Deathlessness,<br>
freely enjoy Cool Peace they have attained.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha shines this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc232"></a>As a pillar firmly planted in the earth<br>
Is unshaken by winds from the four directions,<br>
So too, I say, is the True Person<br>
Who sees the Noble Truths from their own experience.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc233"></a>Who clearly comprehend these Noble Truths<br>
well-taught by him of wisdom fathomless,<br>
however heedless be they afterwards<br>
upon an eighth existence they’ll not seize.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc234"></a>As soon as one with insight is endowed,<br>
three things become discarded utterly:<br>
wrong view of a perduring self, and doubt,<br>
and clinging to vain rites and empty vows.<br>
Escaped that one from all four evil states,<br>
and of the six great sins incapable.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc235"></a>Whatever sort of evil karma done—<br>
by body even, or by speech or mind,<br>
for one to hide these is not possible—<br>
impossible for Seer of the State, it’s said.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc236"></a>Just as a forest grove puts forth its flowers<br>
when the first month of summer heat has come,<br>
so for the highest good of all, He taught<br>
the truth sublime which to Nirvāṇa leads.<br>
Yea, in the Buddha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc237"></a>The Highest One, the Knower of the Highest,<br>
the Giver and the Bringer of the Highest<br>
’tis He who taught the Highest Truth of all.<br>
Yea, in the Buddha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc238"></a>The old is withered up, new being there is not,<br>
now their minds desire no future birth,<br>
destroyed the seeds, no want for future growth,<br>
extinguished are those wise ones as this lamp.<br>
Yea, in the Saṅgha is this glorious gem:<br>
By virtue of this truth, may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc239"></a>Whatever beings are assembled here,<br>
creatures of the earth or spirits of the sky,<br>
to th’ gods-and-men-adored Tathāgata,<br>
to the Buddha let us bow: may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc240"></a>Whatever beings are assembled here,<br>
creatures of earth or spirits of the sky,<br>
to th’ gods-and-men-adored Tathāgata,<br>
to the Dharma let us bow: may blessing be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc241"></a>Whatever beings are assembled here,<br>
creatures of earth or spirits of the sky,<br>
to th’ gods-and-men-adored Tathāgata,<br>
to the Saṅgha let us bow: may blessing be!</p>
