<h1>1.7. Who is the Outcaste?</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then in the morning the Radiant One dressed and, taking bowl and robes, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood. At that time the sacrificial fire was burning in the house of the brahmin Aggika-Bhāradvāja and the offering was held aloft. Then the Radiant One walking in almsround, house by house within Sāvatthī, came to the house of brahmin Aggika-Bhāradvāja. The brahmin saw the Radiant One coming from a distance and called out this to him: “Stop there, mere shaveling, stop there, vile ascetic, stop there, foul outcaste!” When this was said, the Radiant One said to the brahmin: “Do you know, brahmin, what an outcaste is or what things make a person ‘outcaste’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“I do not know good Gotama what an outcaste is or what things make one an outcaste. It would be good for me if the venerable Gotama were to teach me Dharma, so that I might know an outcaste and what things make an outcaste.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Then listen, brahmin, pay attention and I shall tell you.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Yes, venerable sir”, replied the brahmin.</p>

the example following here:<br>
An outcaste boy well-known to you<br>
as Mātaṅga of the Sopakas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc138"></a>Mātaṅga gained the highest fame,<br>

set forth along the spotless path<br>
and cleansed of sense-desired,<br>
attained to Brahma’s world, they say;<br>
unhindered he by “birth” at all<br>
he won to Brahma-worlds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc140"></a>Though born in Veda-chanting clan,<br>
brahmins with mantras as their kin,<br>
frequently indeed they’re seen<br>
while making evil karmas,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc141"></a>Even in this world they’re blamed,<br>
the next for them’s a painful bourn;<br>
birth hinders not a painful bourn,<br>
nor from being blamed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc142"></a>One’s not an outcaste caused by “birth”,<br>
not by “birth” a brahmin is;<br>
caused by karma one’s outcaste,<br>
a brahmin is by karma caused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a>When this was said, the brahmin Aggika-bhāradvāja exclaimed to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by the Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what was overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes can see forms. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember me as an <i>upāsaka</i> who from today has Gone for Refuge for life.”</p>
