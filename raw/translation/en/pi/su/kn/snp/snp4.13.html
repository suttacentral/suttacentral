<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc902"></a><span class="speaker">Question</span><br>
Regarding those people who hold to their views,<br>
Arguing, “Only this is true!”<br>
Should all of them be criticized,<br>
Or are some praiseworthy also?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc903"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
This is a small thing, not enough for peace.<br>
I say there are two outcomes of dispute;<br>
Seeing this one should not dispute,<br>
Recognizing that safety is a place without dispute.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc904"></a>Regarding these widely-held opinions,<br>
One who knows does not get involved with any of them.<br>
Why would the uninvolved become involved,<br>
Since they have no preferences<br>
In what is seen or heard?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc905"></a>Those who consider ethics to be the highest<br>
Say that purity comes from self-restraint.<br>
They undertake a vow and stick to it,<br>
Thinking that only training in this way is there purity,<br>
Declaring themselves experts,<br>
They go to future rebirths.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc906"></a>If he falls away from virtuous conduct and vows,<br>
He is anxious, having failed in his task.<br>
He yearns and longs for purity, as one far from home<br>
Who has lost his travelling companions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc907"></a>But one who abandons all virtue and vows,<br>
and deeds both blameless and blameworthy,<br>
Does not long for either purity or impurity;<br>
he lives detached, fostering peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc908"></a>Dependent on ascetic practices,<br>
Or on what is seen, heard, or thought,<br>
They say that purity comes from continual transmigration,<br>
They are not free of craving for life after life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc909"></a>One who yearns has longings,<br>
And is anxious regarding their aspirations;<br>
But for one here who has no falling away or reappearing,<br>
Why would they be anxious,<br>
Or for what would they long?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc910"></a><span class="speaker">Question</span><br>
The doctrine that some people call the ultimate,<br>
Others say is deficient.<br>
Which of these speaks the truth?<br>
For all of them say they are experts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc911"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
They say their own doctrine is complete,<br>
While that of others is deficient.<br>
Thus arguing they dispute,<br>
Each taking what they agree upon to be the truth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc912"></a>If by criticizing an opponent<br>
Their doctrine became deficient,<br>
There would be no distinguished doctrines,<br>
Because it is common for people to speak<br>
In defence of their own doctrines,<br>
While making the other’s out to be deficient.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc913"></a>Indeed, the honoring of their own teachings<br>
Is nothing other than praise of themselves;<br>
If each doctrine were valid,<br>
Then purity would be just a personal matter.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc914"></a>The brahmin is not led by another,<br>
Considering wisely, they do not grasp any teaching;<br>
Therefore they go beyond disputes,<br>
Since they see no other doctrine as best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc915"></a>Thinking, “I know, I see, this is how it is!”<br>
Some fall back on view as purity.<br>
Even if one has seen, what use is that to them?<br>
Overstepping, they say purity<br>
Comes by some other means.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc916"></a>A person with vision sees mind and body,<br>
And then knows only that much;<br>
Let them see much or little,<br>
The experts say purity does not come from that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc917"></a>One who speaks dogmatically,<br>
Who’s settled down in view,<br>
Will not be deferent, one not easily trained.<br>
To that attached, his own views “pure”,<br>
“pure path” according to what he’s seen.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc918"></a>The paragon with wisdom comes not near<br>
To following views, by partial knowledge bound.<br>
Having known opinions of common people,<br>
He’s equanimous, though others study them.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc919"></a>The sage lets go of all ties to the world,<br>
And when disputes come up they do not take sides;<br>
Peaceful amid the agitated, they are equanimous,<br>
They don’t hold on, thinking, “Let them hold on”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc920"></a>Former corruptions are abandoned,<br>
While new ones are not created,<br>
They have no biasses, and are not dogmatic.<br>
The sage is freed from commitment to views,<br>
Not clinging to the world, nor reproaching themselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc921"></a>They have no enemies in the doctrines,<br>
Whether seen, heard, or thought;<br>
The sage is freed, having put down the burden,<br>
Not planning, not wanting, not wishing.</p>
