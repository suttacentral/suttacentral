Do they say he is a sage because he has knowledge<br>

do the skilful say one is a sage here, Nanda.<br>
Whoever lives without company, not troubled,<br>
not yearning, they are sages, I say.”</p>

say that purity is through countless <span class="add">other</span> ways,<br>
Gracious One, perhaps those living restrained in this way<br>
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

although they are living restrained in this way,<br>
they have not crossed over bith and old age, I say.”</p>

if you say these sages have not crossed the flood,<br>
then just who in the world of the gods and men<br>
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

“are enveloped in birth and old age:<br>
whoever here has given up <span class="add">reliance on</span> what is seen,<br>
heard, or sensed, and virtue and practices,<br>
and has also given up all the countless <span class="add">other</span> ways,<br>
who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free—<br>
I say those men have crossed over the flood.”</p>

Gotama, well-proclaimed is freedom from clinging!<br>
Whoever here has given up <span class="add">reliance on</span> what is seen,<br>
