Cooked is the evening rice, all milked the kine,<br>
by Mahī’s banks with friends, good cheer is mine,<br>
my house well-thatched, my fire glows bright and still,<br>
and so, rain on O sky, if such thy will!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc19"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Hatred and barrenness from me are gone,<br>
by Mahī’s banks I bide this night alone,<br>
my house unroofed, my fires in ashes lie:<br>
so, an it liketh thee, rain on O sky!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc20"></a><span class="speaker">Dhaniya</span><br>
No stinging gnats are here to tease and fret,<br>
my cattle crop the grasses lush and wet,<br>
and take no hurt though floods the valley fill:<br>
and so, rain on O sky, if such thy will!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc21"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
The raft is bound and well together cast,<br>
the Further Shore attained, the flood o’erpassed;<br>
of well-made raft what further need have I?<br>
so, an it liketh thee, rain on O sky!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc22"></a><span class="speaker">Dhaniya</span><br>
Attentive is my wife, no wanton she,<br>
long have I lived with her full happily,<br>
nor ever heard of her a breath of ill:<br>
and so, rain on O sky, if such thy will!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc23"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
My mind attentive is, from passion freed,<br>
long trained in wisdom’s way, well-tamed indeed:<br>
evil in me, what searcher can espy?<br>
so, an it liketh thee, rain on O sky!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc24"></a><span class="speaker">Dhaniya</span><br>
My needs are met by my own body’s hire,<br>
my sturdy boys sit round my own house fire,<br>
nor do I hear of them one word of ill:<br>
and so, rain on O sky, if such thy will!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc25"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
No hireling I; to servile bonds inclined,<br>
I walk all worlds with what I’ve earned in mind,<br>
of wage or hire no smallest need have I:<br>
so, an it liketh thee, rain on O sky!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc26"></a><span class="speaker">Dhaniya</span><br>
Cattle have I, yea, cows in milk are mine,<br>
and cows with calf, and tender rising kine,<br>
and lordly bulls whose ways the herds fulfil:<br>
and so, rain on O sky, if such thy will!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc27"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Cattle I’ve none nor cows in milk are mine<br>
nor cows with calf, nor tender rising kine,<br>
nor lordly bulls to lead the herds have I:<br>
so, an it liketh thee, rain on O sky!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc28"></a><span class="speaker">Dhaniya</span><br>
The stakes all deeply driven, set firm and sure,<br>
the newly-plaited ropes of grass secure.<br>
No frenzied beast can break by any skill:<br>
and so, rain on O sky, if such thy will!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc29"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Like bull, bursting the bond of plaited twine,<br>
or elephant breaking free from stinky-vine,<br>
ne’er again I’ll enter in a womb to lie:<br>
so, an it liketh thee, rain on O sky!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc30"></a><span class="speaker">Narrator</span><br>
And now the furious showers came down amain<br>
in pouring floods that covered hill and plain,<br>
and, listening to the beating of the rain<br>
Dhaniya, faithful, thus found voice again.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc31"></a><span class="speaker">Dhaniya</span><br>
Surely our gain is great and to be praised,<br>
whose eyes upon the Radiant One have gazed!<br>
O Seeing One, we for refuge go to thee!<br>
O Mighty Sage do Thou our Teacher be!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc32"></a>Attentive, lo! We wait my wife and I,<br>
to live the goodly life, the pathway high,<br>
that leads beyond all birth and death to know<br>
and win the final end of every woe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc33"></a><span class="speaker">Māra</span><br>
He who has boys rejoices in his boys,<br>
he who has kine, of kine are all his joys.<br>
Man’s assets surely are his chiefest treasure,<br>
who has not assets how shall he have pleasure?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc34"></a><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><br>
Whoso has boys, has sorrow of his boys,<br>
whoso has kine, by kine come his annoys.<br>
Man’s assets, these of all his woes are chief.<br>
Who has no assets, nevermore has grief.</p>
