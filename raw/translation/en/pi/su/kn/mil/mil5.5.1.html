<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi211"></a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, the Blessed One said:<br>
In friendship of the world anxiety is born,<br>
In household life distraction’s dust springs up,<br>
The state set free from home and friendship’s ties,<br>
That, and that only, is the recluse’s aim.” <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en2"></a></p>

<p>‘But on the other hand he said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Let therefore the wise man,<br>
Regarding his own weal,<br>
Have pleasant dwelling-places built,<br>
And lodge there learned men.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, venerable Nāgasena, if the former of these two passages was really spoken by the Tathāgata, then the second must be wrong. But if the Tathāgata really said: “Have pleasant dwelling-places built,” then the former statement must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi212"></a> ‘Both the passages you have quoted, O king, were spoken by the Tathāgata. And the former is a statement as to the nature of things, an inclusive statement, a statement which leaves no room for anything to be supplemented to it, or to be added to it in the way of gloss, as to what is seemly and appropriate and proper for a recluse, and as to the mode of life which a recluse should adopt, the path he should walk along, and the practice he should follow. For just, O king, as a deer in the forest, wandering in the woods, sleeps wherever he desires, having no home and no <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en3"></a> dwelling-place, so also should the recluse be of opinion that</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“In friendship of the world anxiety is born,<br>
In household life distraction’s dust springs up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3"></a>‘But when the Blessed One said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Have pleasant dwelling-places built,<br>
And lodge there learned men,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that was said with respect to two matters only. And what are those two? the gift of a dwelling-place (Vihāra) has been praised and approved, esteemed and highly spoken of, by all the Buddhas. And those who have made such a gift shall be delivered from rebirth, old age, and death. This is the first of the advantages in the gift of a dwelling-place. And again, if there be a common dwelling place (a Vihāra) the sisters of the Order will have a clearly ascertained place of rendezvous, and those who wish to visit (the brethren of the Order) will find it an easy matter to do so. Whereas if there were no homes for the members of the Order it would be difficult to visit them. This is the second of the advantages in the gift of a dwelling-place (a Vihāra). It was with reference to these two matters only that it was said by the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Have pleasant dwelling-places built,<br>
And lodge there learned men.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi213"></a> ‘And it does not follow from that that the sons of the Buddha should harbour longings after the household life.’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en4"></a></p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’</p>
<p class="endsection">Here ends the dilemma as to dwelling-places.</p>
