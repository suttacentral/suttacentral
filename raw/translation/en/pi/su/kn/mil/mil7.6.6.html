<h1>7.6.6.  The Indian Crane</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the Indian crane you say he ought to take, which is it?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the Indian crane by its cry makes known to other folk the good fortune or disaster that is about to happen to them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, make known to others by his preaching of the Dhamma how dreadful a state is purgatory, and how blissful is Nirvāṇa. This, O king, is the quality of the Indian crane he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Piṇḍola Bhāra-dvāja, the elder: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en346"></a></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Two matters there are that the earnest recluse<br>
Should ever to others be making clear—<br>
How fearful, how terrible, purgatory is;<br>
How great and how deep is Nirvāṇa’s bliss.”’</p>
