<h1>7.3.3.  The Seed</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en296"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of seed which you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as seed, tiny though it be, yet if sown in good soil, and if the god rains aright, will give abundant fruit; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, so conduct himself aright that the righteousness of his life may give abundantly of the fruits of Samanaship. This, O king, is the first quality of seed which he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6"></a>‘And again, O king, as seed planted in well-weeded soil comes quickly to maturity; just so, O king, will his mind, when well-mastered, and well-purified in solitude, if it be cast by the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, into the excellent field of self-possession, come quickly to maturity. This, O king, is the second quality of seed which he ought to have. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi376"></a> For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“If seed be sown on a well-weeded field,<br>
Its fruit, abounding, will rejoice the sower.<br>
So the recluse’s heart, in solitude made pure,<br>
Matures full fast in self-possession’s field.”’</p>
