<h1>6.2.10.  Dilemma the Seventieth. The Seasons</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs24"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, why is it that the heat of the sun is more fierce in winter than in summer?’</p>
<p>‘In the hot season, O king, dust is blown up into clouds, and pollen agitated by the winds rises up into the sky, and clouds multiply in the heavens, and gales blow with exceeding force. All these crowded and heaped together shut off the rays of the sun, and so in the hot season the heat of the sun is diminished. But in the cold season, O king, the earth below is at rest, the rains above are <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en113"></a> in reserve, the dust is quiet, the pollen wanders gently through the air, the sky is free from clouds, and very gently do the breezes blow. Since all these have ceased to act the rays of the sun become clear, and freed from every obstruction the sun’s heat glows and burns. This, O king, is the reason why the heat of the sun is more fierce in winter than in summer.</p>
<p>‘So it is when set free from the obstacles besetting it that the sun burns fiercely, which it cannot do when the rains and so on are present with it.’</p>
<p>[‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’]</p>
