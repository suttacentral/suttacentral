<h1>7.4.8.  The Sun</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs36"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, the seven qualities of the sun you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the sun evaporates all water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, cause all evil inclinations, without any exception, to dry up within him. This, O king, is the first quality of the sun he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs37"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sun dispels the darkness; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, dispel all the darkness of lust, and of anger, and of dullness, and of pride, and of heresy, and of evil, and of all unrighteousness. This, O king, is the second quality of the sun he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs38"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sun is always in motion; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be ever thoughtful. This, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en321"></a> O king, is the third quality of the sun he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs39"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sun has a halo of rays; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have a halo of meditation. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the sun he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs40"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sun continually warms multitudes of people; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice the whole world of gods and men with good conduct, and righteousness, and virtue <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi390"></a>, and the performance of duty, and with the <em>Gh</em>ānas, and the Vimokkhas, and Samādhi, and the Samāpattis (various modes of transcendental meditation or ecstacy), and with the five moral powers, and the seven kinds of wisdom, and the four modes of being mindful and self-possessed, and the fourfold great struggle against evil, and the pursuit of the four roads to saintship. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the sun he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs41"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sun is terrified with the fear of Rāhu (the demon of eclipses); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, seeing how beings are entangled in the waste wildernesses of evil life and rebirth in states of woe, caught in the net of the mournful results here of evil done in former births, or of punishment in purgatory, or of evil inclinations, terrify his mind with a great anxiety and fear. This, O king, is the sixth quality of the sun he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs42"></a>‘And again, O king, as the sun makes manifest the evil and the good; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, make manifest <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en322"></a>The moral powers, and the kinds of wisdom, and the modes of being mindful and self-possessed, and the struggle against evil, and the paths to saintship, and all qualities temporal and spiritual. This, O king, is the seventh quality of the sun he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Vaṅgīsa, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“As the rising sun makes plain to all that live<br>
Forms pure and impure, forms both good and bad,<br>
So should the Bhikshu, like the rising orb,<br>
Bearing the scriptures ever in his mind,<br>
Make manifest to men, in ignorance blind,<br>
The many-sided Noble Path of bliss.”’</p>
