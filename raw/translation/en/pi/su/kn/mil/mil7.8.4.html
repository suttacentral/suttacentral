<h1>7.8.4.  The Rice Field</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en367"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those three qualities of the rice field you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the rice field is provided with canals for irrigation; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be provided with the lists of the various duties incumbent on the righteous man—the canals that bring the water to the rice fields of the Buddha’s doctrine. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the rice field he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the rice field is provided with embankments whereby men keep the water in, and so bring the crop to maturity; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be provided with the embankments of righteousness of life, and shame at sin, and thereby keep his Samaṇaship intact, and gain the fruits thereof. This, O king, is the second quality of the rice field he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the rice field is fruitful, filling the heart of the farmer with joy, so that if the seed be little the crop is great, and if the seed be much the crop is greater still; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be fruitful to the bearing of much good fruit, making the hearts of those who support him to rejoice, so that where little is given the result is great, and where much is given the result is greater still. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en368"></a> This, O king, is the third quality of the rice field he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upāli, the Elder, he who carried the rules of the Order in his head:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Be fruitful as a rice field, yea, be rich<br>
In all good works! For that is the best field<br>
Which yieldeth to the sower the goodliest crop.”’</p>
