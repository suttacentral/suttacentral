<h1>3.6.3.  The marks of a great man</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi75"></a>The king said: ‘Is it true, Nāgasena, that the Buddha was endowed with the thirty-two bodily marks of a great man, and graced with the eighty subsidiary characteristics; that he was golden in colour with a skin like gold, and that there spread around him a glorious halo of a fathom’s length?’</p>
<p>‘Such, O king, was the Blessed One.’</p>
<p>‘But were his parents like that?’</p>
<p>‘No, they were not.’</p>
<p>‘In that case you must say that he was born so. But surely a son is either like his mother, or those on <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en117"></a>The mother’s side, or he is like his father, or those on the father’s side!’</p>
<p>The Elder replied: ‘Is there such a thing, O king, as a lotus flower with a hundred petals?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, there is.’</p>
<p>‘Where does it grow up?’</p>
<p>‘It is produced in mud, and in water it comes to perfection.’</p>
<p>‘But does the lotus resemble the mud of the lake, whence it springs up, either in colour, or in smell, or in taste?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>
<p>‘Then does it resemble the water?’</p>
<p>‘Nor that either.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, is it that the Blessed One had the bodily signs and marks you have mentioned, though his parents had them not.’</p>
<p>‘Well answered, Nāgasena!’</p>
