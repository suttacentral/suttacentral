<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en57"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11"></a>The king said: ‘What, Nāgasena, is the characteristic mark of perseverance?’</p>
<p>‘The rendering of support, O king, is the mark of perseverance. All those good qualities which it supports do not fall away.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Just as a man, if a house were falling, would make a prop for it of another post, and the house so supported would not fall; just so, O king, is the rendering of support the mark of perseverance, and all those good qualities which it supports do not fall away.’</p>
<p>‘Give me a further illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Just as when a large army has broken up a small one, then the king of the latter would call to mind every possible ally and reinforce his small army, and by that means the small army might in its turn break up the large one; just so, O king, is the rendering of support the mark of perseverance, and all those good qualities which it supports do not fall away <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi37"></a>. For it has been said by the Blessed One: “The persevering hearer of the noble truth, O Bhikkhus, puts away evil and cultivates goodness, puts away that which is wrong and developes in himself that which is right, and thus does he keep himself pure.”’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en58"></a></p>
<p>‘Well put, Nāgasena!’</p>
