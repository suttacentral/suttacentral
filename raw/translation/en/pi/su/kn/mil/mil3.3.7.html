<h1>3.3.7.  Thought and sight</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a>The king said: ‘Does thought-perception arise wherever sight arises ?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, O king, where the one is there is the other.’ And which of the two arises first?’</p>
<p>‘First sight, then thought.’</p>
<p>‘Then does the sight issue, as it were, a command to thought, saying: “Do you spring up there where I have? or does thought issue command to sight, saying: Where you spring up there will I.”’</p>
<p>‘It is not so, great king. There is no intercourse between the one and the other.’</p>
<p>‘Then how is it, Sir, that thought arises wherever sight does?’</p>
<p>‘Because of there being a sloping down, and because of there being a door, and because of there being a habit, and because of there being an association.’</p>
<p>‘How is that? Give me an illustration of mind arising where sight arises because of there being a sloping down.’</p>
<p>‘Now what do you think, great king? When it rains, where will the water go to?’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en90"></a></p>
<p>‘It will follow the slope of the ground.’</p>
<p>‘And if it were to rain again, where would the water go to?’</p>
<p>‘It would go the same way as the first water had gone.’</p>
<p>‘What then? Does the first water issue, as it were, command to the second, saying: “Do you go where I have?” Or does the second issue command to the first, saying: “Whithersoever you go, thither will I”?’</p>
<p>‘It is not so, Sir. There is no intercourse between the two. Each goes its way because of the slope of the ground.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi58"></a> is it by reason of the natural slope that where sight has arisen there also does thought arise. And neither does the sight-perception issue command to the mind-perception, saying: “Where I have arisen, there do thou also spring up;” nor does the mind-perception inform the sight-perception, saying: “Where thou hast arisen, there will I also spring up.” There is no conversation, as it were, between them. All that happens, happens through natural slope.’</p>
<p>‘Now give me an illustration of there being a door.’</p>
<p>‘What do you think, great king? Suppose a king had a frontier city, and it was strongly defended with towers and bulwarks, and had only one gateway. If a man wanted to leave the city, how would he go out?’</p>
<p>‘By the gate, certainly.’</p>
<p>‘And if another man wanted to leave it, how would he go out?’</p>
<p>‘The same way as the first.’</p>
<p>‘What then? Would the first man tell the second: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en91"></a> “Mind you go out the same way as I do”? Or would the second tell the first: “The way you go out, I shall go out too”?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not, Sir. There would be no communication between them. They would go that way because that was the gate.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, with thought and sight.’</p>
<p>‘Now give me an illustration of thought arising where sight is because of habit.’</p>
<p>‘What do you think, great king? If one cart went ahead, which way would a second cart go?’</p>
<p>‘The same as the first.’</p>
<p>‘But would the first tell the second to go where it went, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi59"></a> or the second tell the first that it would go where it (the first) had gone?’</p>
<p>‘No, Sir. There would be no communication between the two. The second would follow the first out of habit.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, with sight and thought.’</p>
<p>‘Now give me an illustration of how thought arises, where sight has arisen, through association.’</p>
<p>‘In the art of calculating by using the joints of the fingers as signs or marks, in the art of arithmetic pure and simple, in the art of estimating the probable <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en92"></a> yield of growing crops, and in the art of writing, O king, the beginner is clumsy. But after a certain time with attention and practice he becomes expert. just so is it that, where sight has arisen, thought too by association springs up.’</p>
<p>And in response to similar questions, the Elder declared that in the same way thought sprang up wherever there was hearing, or taste, or smell, or touch: that in each case it was subsequent to the other, but arose without communication from <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi60"></a>The natural causes above set out.</p>
