<h1>7.2.9.  The Crow</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the crow that you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the crow goes about full of apprehension and suspicion, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi373"></a> always on watch and guard; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, go about full of apprehension and suspicion, always on watch and guard, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en292"></a> in full self-possession, with his senses under control. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the crow he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20"></a>‘And again, O king, as the crow, whatever food he catches sight of, eats it, sharing with his kind; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never omit to share with virtuous co-religionists, and that without distinction of person or deliberation as to quantity, whatever lawful gifts he may have lawfully received, down even to the contents of his begging-bowl. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the crow he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Whate’er they may present to me, austere in life,<br>
All that, just as it comes, do I divide<br>
With all, and I myself then take my food.”’</p>
