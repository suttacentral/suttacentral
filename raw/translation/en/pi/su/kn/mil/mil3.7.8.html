<h1>3.7.8.  Intentional wrong doing</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8"></a>The king said: ‘Whose, Nāgasena, is the greater demerit—his who sins consciously, or his who sins inadvertently?’</p>
<p>‘He who sins inadvertently, O king, has the greater demerit.’</p>
<p>‘In that case, reverend Sir, we shall punish doubly any of our family or our court who do wrong unintentionally.’</p>
<p>‘But what do you think, O king? If one man were to seize hold intentionally of a fiery mass of metal glowing with heat, and another were to seize hold of it unintentionally, which would be more burnt?’</p>
<p>‘The one who did not know what he was doing.’</p>
<p>‘Well, it is just the same with the man who does wrong.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
