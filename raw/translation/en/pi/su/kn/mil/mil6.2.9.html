<h1>6.2.9.  Dilemma the Sixty-Ninth. The Heat Of the Sun</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, does this sun always burn fiercely, or are there times when it shines with diminished heat?’</p>
<p>‘It always burns fiercely, O king, never gently.’</p>
<p>‘But if that be so, how is it that the heat of the sun is sometimes fierce, and sometimes not ?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs23"></a>‘There are four derangements, O king, which happen to the sun, and affected by one or other of these its heat is allayed. And what are the four? the clouds, O king, and fog, and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en112"></a> smoke, and eclipses —these are the four derangements which happen to the sun, and it is when affected by one or other of these that its heat is allayed.’</p>
<p>‘Most wonderful, Nāgasena, and most strange <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi274"></a> that even the sun, so transcendent in glory, should suffer from derangement-how much more then other, lesser, creatures. No one else could have made this explanation except one wise like you!’</p>
<p class="endsection">Here ends the dilemma as to the heat of the sun.</p>
