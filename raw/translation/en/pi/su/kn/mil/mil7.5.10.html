<h1>7.5.10.  The Elephant</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs18"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, the five qualities of the elephant he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the elephant, as he walks about, crushes the earth; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, mastering the nature of the body, crush out all evil. This, O king, is the first quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19"></a>‘And again, O king, as the elephant turns his whole body when he looks, always looking straight before him, not glancing round this way and that ; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, turn his whole body when he looks, always looking straight before, not glancing round this way and that, not looking aloft, not looking at his feet, but keeping his eyes fixed about a yoke’s length in front of him. This, O king, is the second quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20"></a>‘And again, O king, as the elephant has no permanent lair, even in seeking his food does not always frequent the same spot, has no fixed place of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en336"></a> abode; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have no permanent resting-place, but without a home should go his rounds for alms. Full of insight, wherever he sees a pleasant suitable agreeable place, whether in a hut or at the foot of a tree, or in a cave, or on a mountain side, there should he dwell, not taking up a fixed abode. This, O king, is the third quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21"></a>‘And again, O king, as the elephant revels in the water, plunging into glorious lotus ponds full of clear pure cool water, and covered-over with lotuses yellow, and blue, and red, and white, sporting there in the games in which the mighty beast delights; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi399"></a> just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, plunge into the glorious pond of self-possession, covered with the flowers of emancipation, filled with the delicious waters of the pure and stainless clear and limpid Truth; there should he by knowledge shake off and drive away the Saṃkhāras, there should he revel in the sport that is the delight of the recluse. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the elephant he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22"></a>‘And again, O king, as the elephant lifts up his foot with care, and puts it down with care; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be mindful and self-possessed in lifting <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en337"></a> up his feet and in putting them down, in going or returning, in stretching his arm or drawing it back—wherever he is he should be mindful and self-possessed. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the elephant he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Saṃyutta Nikāya:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Good is restraint in action,<br>
And good restraint in speech,<br>
Good is restraint in mind,<br>
Restraint throughout is good.<br>
Well guarded is he said to be<br>
Who is ashamed of sin, in all things self-controlled.”’</p>
