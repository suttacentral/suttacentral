<h1>7.3.6.  The Anchor</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en299"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the anchor which you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the anchor, even in the mighty sea, in the expanse of waters agitated by the crowding of ever-varying waves, will fasten the ship, and keep it still, not letting the sea take it in one direction or another; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his mind stedfast in the mighty struggle of thoughts, in the waters of the waves of lust and malice and dullness, not letting them divert it in one direction or another. This, O king, is the first quality of the anchor he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12"></a>‘And again, O king, as the anchor floats not, but sinks down, and even in water a hundred cubits deep holds the ship fast, brings it to rest; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he receives support, and fame, and honour, and veneration, and reverence, and offerings, and praise, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi378"></a> be not lifted up on the summit of the support or the fame, but keep his mind fixed on the idea of merely keeping his body alive. This, O king, is the second quality of the anchor he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“As the anchor floats not, but sinks down beneath the waves,<br>
So be abased, not lifted up, by praise or gifts.”’</p>
