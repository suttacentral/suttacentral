<h1>3.5.7.  Does a being transmigrate?</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi72"></a>The king said: ‘Is there any being, Nāgasena, who transmigrates from this body to another?’</p>
<p>‘No, there is not.’</p>
<p>‘But if so, would it not get free from its evil deeds.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, if it were not reborn; but if it were, no.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Suppose, O king, a man were to steal another man’s mangoes, would the thief deserve punishment?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘But he would not have stolen the mangoes the other set in the ground. Why would he deserve punishment?’</p>
<p>‘Because those he stole were the result of those that were planted.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, this name-and-form commits deeds, either pure or impure, and by that Karma another name-and-form. is reborn. And therefore is it not set free from its evil deeds?’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
