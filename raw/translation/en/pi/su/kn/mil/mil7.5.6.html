<h1>7.5.6.  The Old Male Jackal</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi395"></a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, the two qualities of the old male jackal you say he ought to take, which are they?’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en330"></a></p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the old male jackal, whatever kind of food he finds, feels no disgust, but eats of it as much as he requires; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, eat without disgust such food as he receives with the sole object of keeping himself alive. This, O king, is the first quality of the old male jackal he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahā Kassapa, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Leaving my dwelling-place, I entered once<br>
Upon my round for alms, the village street.<br>
A leper there I saw eating his meal,<br>
And, as was meet, deliberately, in turn,<br>
I stood beside him too that he might give a gift.<br>
He, with his hand all leprous and diseased,<br>
Put in my bowl—’twas all he had to give—<br>
A ball of rice; and as he placed it there<br>
A finger, mortifying, broke and fell.<br>
Seated behind a wall, that ball of food<br>
I ate, and neither when I ate it, nay,<br>
Nor afterwards, did any loathing thought<br>
Arise within my breast.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8"></a>‘And again, O king, as the old male jackal, when he gets any food, does not stop to examine it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never stop to find out whether food given to him is bitter or sweet, well-flavoured or ill—just as it is should he be satisfied with it. This, O king, is the second quality of the old male jackal <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en331"></a> he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena Vaṅganta-putta, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Bitter food too should he enjoy,<br>
Nor long for what is sweet to taste.<br>
The mind disturbed by lust of taste<br>
Can ne’er enjoy the ecstacies<br>
Of meditations high. The man content<br>
With anything that’s given—in him alone<br>
Is Samaṇaship made perfect.”’</p>
