<h1>3.1.3.  (Interlude) How kings and scholars respectively discuss</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3"></a>The king said: ‘Reverend Sir, will you discuss with me again?’</p>
<p>‘If your Majesty will discuss as a scholar (paṇḍit), well; but if you will discuss as a king, no.’</p>
<p>‘How is it then that scholars discuss?’</p>
<p>‘When scholars talk a matter over one with another then is there a winding up, an unravelling; one or other is convicted of error, and he then acknowledges his mistake; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi29"></a> distinctions are drawn, and contra-distinctions ; and yet thereby they are not angered. Thus do scholars, O king, discuss.’</p>
<p>‘And how do kings discuss?’</p>
<p>‘When a king, your Majesty, discusses a matter, and he advances a point, if any one differ from him on that point, he is apt to fine him, saying: “Inflict such and such a punishment upon that fellow!” Thus, your Majesty, do kings discuss.’</p>
<p>‘Very well. It is as a scholar, not as a king, that I will discuss. Let your reverence talk unrestrainedly, as you would with a brother, or a novice, or a lay disciple, or even with a servant. Be not afraid!’ <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en47"></a></p>
<p>‘Very good, your Majesty,’ said Nāgasena, with thankfulness.</p>
<p>‘Nāgasena, I have a question to ask you;’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Pray ask it, Sire.’</p>
<p>‘I have asked it, your Reverence.’</p>
<p>‘That is answered already.’</p>
<p>‘What have you answered?’</p>
<p>‘To what, then, does your Majesty refer?’</p>
