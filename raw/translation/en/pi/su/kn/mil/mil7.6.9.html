<h1>7.6.9.  The Serpent</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en348"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those three qualities of the serpent you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the serpent progresses by means of its belly; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, progress by means of his knowledge. For the heart of the recluse, O king, who progresses by knowledge, continues in perception (of the four Truths), that which is inconsistent with the characteristics of a recluse does he put away, that which is consistent with them does he develop in himself. This, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi406"></a> O king, is the first quality of the serpent he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the serpent as it moves avoids drugs ; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, go on his way avoiding unrighteousness. This, O king, is the second quality of the serpent he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22"></a>‘And again, O king, as the serpent on catching sight of men is anxious, and pained, and seeks a way of escape ; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he finds himself thinking wrong thoughts, or discontent arising within him, be anxious and pained, and seek a way of escape, saying to himself: “This day must I have spent in carelessness, and never shall I be able to recover it.” This, O king, is the third quality of the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en349"></a> serpent he ought to have. For it is a saying, O king, of the two fairy birds in the Bhallāṭiya Jātaka:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“’Tis one night only, hunter, that we’ve spent<br>
Away from home, and that against our will,<br>
And thinking all night through of one another,<br>
Yet that one night is it that we bemoan,<br>
And grieve; for nevermore can it return!”’</p>
