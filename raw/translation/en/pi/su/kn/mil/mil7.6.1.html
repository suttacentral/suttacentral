<h1>7.6.1.  The Lion</h1>

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en338"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those seven qualities of the lion you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the lion is of a clear, stainless, and pure light yellow colour; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be clear, stainless, and pure light in mind, free from anger and moroseness. This, O king, is the first quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2"></a>‘And again, O king, as the lion has four paws as his means of travelling, and is rapid in his gait; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, move along the four paths of saintship. This, O king, is the second quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3"></a>‘And again, O king, as the lion has a beautiful coat of hair, pleasant to behold; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have a beautiful coat of righteousness, pleasant to behold. This, O king, is the third quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4"></a>‘And again, O king, as the lion, even were his life to cease, bows down before no man; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, even though he should cease to obtain all the requisites of a recluse—food and clothing and lodging and medicine for the sick—never bow down <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en339"></a> to any man. This is the fourth quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5"></a>‘And again, O king, as the lion eats regularly on, wheresoever his prey falls there does he eat whatever he requires, and seeks not out the best morsels of flesh; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, stand for alms at each hut in regular order, not seeking out the families where he would be given better food, not missing out any house upon his rounds, he should not pick and choose in eating, wheresoever he may have received a mouthful of rice there should he eat it, seeking not for the best morsels. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6"></a>‘And again, O king, as the lion is not a storer up of what he eats, and when he has once eaten of his prey returns not again to it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never be a storer up of food. This is the sixth quality of the lion he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi401"></a> ‘And again, O king, as the lion, even if he gets no food, is not alarmed, and if he does, then he eats it without craving, without faintness, without sinking ; just so, O king, should the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en340"></a> strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be not alarmed even if he gets no food, and if he does then should he eat it without craving, without faintness, without sinking, conscious of the danger in the lust of taste, in full knowledge of the right outcome of eating (the maintenance of life for the pursuit of holiness). This, O king, is the seventh quality of the lion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta Nikāya, when he was exalting Mahā Kassapa, the Elder:</p>
<p>“This Kassapa, O Bhikshus, is content with such food as he receives, he magnifies the being content with whatever food one gets, he is not guilty of anything improper or unbecoming for the sake of an alms, if he receive none, yet is he not alarmed, and if he does then does he eat it without craving, without faintness, without sinking, conscious of danger, with full knowledge of the right object in taking food.”’</p>
