<h1>7.7.6.  The Rain</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en356"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12"></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those five qualities of the rain you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the rain lays any dust that arises; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, lay the dust and dirt of any evil dispositions that may arise within him. This, O king, is the first quality of the rain he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the rain allays the heat of the ground; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, soothe the whole world of gods and men, with the feeling of his love. This, O king, is the second quality of the rain he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14"></a>‘And again, O king, as the rain makes all kinds of vegetation to grow; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, cause faith to spring up in all beings, and make that seed of faith grow up into the three Attainments, not only the lesser attainments of glorious rebirths in heaven or on earth, but also the attainment of the highest good, the bliss of Arahatship. This, O king, is the third quality of the rain he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15"></a>‘And again, O king, just as the rain-cloud, rising up in the hot season, affords protection to the grass, and trees, and creepers, and shrubs, and medicinal herbs, and to the monarchs of the woods that grow on the surface of the earth; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en357"></a> cultivating the habit of thoughtfulness, afford protection by his thoughtfulness to his condition of Samanaship, for in thoughtfulness is it that all good qualities have their root. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the rain he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi411"></a> ‘And again, O king, as the rain when it pours down fills the rivers, and reservoirs, and artificial lakes, the caves, and chasms, and ponds, and holes, and wells, with water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, pour down the rain of the Dhamma—according to the texts handed down by tradition, and so fill to satisfaction the mind of those who are longing for instruction. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the rain he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>

<p>“When the Great Sage perceives a man afar,<br>
Were it a hundred or a thousand leagues,<br>
Ripe for enlightenment, straightway he goes<br>
And guides him gently to the path of Truth.”’</p>
