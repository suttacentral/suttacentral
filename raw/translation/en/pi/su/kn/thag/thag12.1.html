<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc608"></a>One should train just in virtue,<br>
For in this world, when virtue is<br>
Cultivated and well-trained,<br>
It provides all success.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc609"></a>Desiring three kinds of happiness—<br>
Praise, prosperity,<br>
And to delight in heaven after passing away—<br>
The wise should protect virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc610"></a>The well-behaved have many friends,<br>
Because of their self-restraint.<br>
But one without virtue, of bad conduct,<br>
Drives away their friends.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc611"></a>A person of bad behavior has<br>
Ill-repute and infamy.<br>
A person of virtue always has<br>
A good reputation, fame, and praise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc612"></a>Virtue is the starting point and foundation;<br>
The mother at the head<br>
Of all good qualities:<br>
Therefore you should purify virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc613"></a>Virtue is a boundary and a restraint,<br>
An enjoyment for the mind;<br>
The place where all the Buddhas cross over:<br>
Therefore you should purify virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc614"></a>Virtue is the matchless power;<br>
Virtue is the ultimate weapon;<br>
Virtue is the best ornament;<br>
Virtue is a marvellous coat of armour.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc615"></a>Virtue is a mighty bridge;<br>
Virtue is the unsurpassed scent;<br>
Virtue is the best perfume,<br>
That floats in all directions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc616"></a>Virtue is the best provision;<br>
Virtue is the unsurpassed supply for a journey;<br>
Virtue is the best vehicle,<br>
That takes you in all directions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc617"></a>In this life they’re criticized;<br>
After passing away they’re unhappy in a lower realm;<br>
A fool is unhappy everywhere,<br>
Because they are not endowed with virtues.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc618"></a>In this life they’re famous;<br>
After passing away they’re happy in heaven;<br>
A person with understanding is happy everywhere,<br>
Because they are endowed with virtues.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc619"></a>Virtue is best in this life,<br>
But person with understanding is supreme<br>
Among humans and gods,<br>
Conquering with virtue and understanding.</p>
