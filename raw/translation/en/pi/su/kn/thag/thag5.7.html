<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc345"></a>Three times a day—<br>
Morning, midday, and evening—<br>
I went down into the water at Gayā,<br>
For the Gayā spring festival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc346"></a>“Whatever bad things I’ve done<br>
In previous births,<br>
I’ll now wash away right here”—<br>
This is the view I previously held.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc347"></a>Having heard the well-spoken words<br>
Regarding the Dhamma and the goal,<br>
I wisely reflected<br>
On the true, essential goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc348"></a>I’ve washed away all bad things<br>
I’m stainless, cleansed, pristine;<br>
The pure heir of the pure one,<br>
A rightful son of the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc349"></a>When I plunged into the eight-fold stream,<br>
All bad things were washed away.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
