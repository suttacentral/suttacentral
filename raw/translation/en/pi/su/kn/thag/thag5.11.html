<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc365"></a>I’ve received full ordination,<br>
I am liberated, without defilements,<br>
I’ve seen the Blessed One myself,<br>
And even stayed together with him.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc366"></a>The Blessed One, the teacher,<br>
Spent much of the night in the open;<br>
Then he, who is so skilled at dwelling in meditation,<br>
Entered his dwelling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc367"></a>Spreading out his outer robe,<br>
Gotama made his bed;<br>
Like a lion in a rocky cave,<br>
With fear and dread abandoned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc368"></a>Then, with lovely enunciation,<br>
Soṇa, a disciple of the Buddha,<br>
Recited the true Dhamma<br>
In the presence of the best of Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc369"></a>When he has fully understood the five aggregates,<br>
Developed the straight path,<br>
And arrived at the highest peace,<br>
He will realize <i>nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
