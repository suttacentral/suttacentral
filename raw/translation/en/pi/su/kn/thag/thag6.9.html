<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc423"></a>I was intoxicated with the pride of birth,<br>
And wealth and sovereignty,<br>
I lived intoxicated<br>
With the beauty and form of my body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc424"></a>No-one was my equal or my better—<br>
Or so I thought.<br>
I was such an arrogant fool,<br>
Stuck up, waving my own flag.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc425"></a>I didn’t pay respects to anyone:<br>
Not my mother or father,<br>
Nor others considered to be honorable.<br>
I was stiff with conceit, and disrespectful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc426"></a>When I saw the supreme leader,<br>
The most excellent of charioteers,<br>
Shining like the sun,<br>
And revered by the monastic Saṅgha,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc427"></a>I discarded conceit and intoxication,<br>
And, with a clear and confident heart,<br>
I bowed down with my head<br>
To the highest of all beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc428"></a>The conceit of superiority and the conceit of inferiority<br>
Have been abandoned and uprooted.<br>
The conceit “I am” has been eradicated,<br>
And every kind of conceit has been destroyed.</p>
