<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc547"></a>If you’re prepared for the future,<br>
Both the good and the bad,<br>
Then those who look for your weakness,<br>
Whether enemies or well-wishers, will find none.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc548"></a>One who has fulfilled, developed,<br>
And gradually consolidated<br>
Mindfulness of breathing<br>
As taught by the Buddha:<br>
They light up the world,<br>
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc549"></a>Yes, my mind is clean,<br>
Measureless, and well-developed;<br>
It is broken through and uplifted—<br>
It radiates in every direction.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc550"></a>The wise person lives on<br>
Even after loss of wealth;<br>
But without gaining wisdom<br>
Even a rich person doesn’t really live.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc551"></a>Understanding questions what is learned;<br>
Understanding grows fame and reputation;<br>
A person who has understanding<br>
Finds happiness even among sufferings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc552"></a>It’s not something just for today;<br>
It isn’t incredible or astonishing.<br>
When you’re born, you die—<br>
What’s astonishing about that?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc553"></a>For anyone who is born,<br>
Death always follows after living.<br>
Everyone who is born here dies here;<br>
Such is the nature of living beings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc554"></a>The things that are useful for the living<br>
Are of no use for the dead—<br>
Not fame, not celebrity,<br>
Not praise by ascetics and brahmins;<br>
For the dead, there is only weeping.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc555"></a>And weeping impairs the eye and the body;<br>
Complexion, health, and intelligence decline.<br>
Your enemies rejoice;<br>
But your well-wishers are not happy.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc556"></a>So you should wish that those who stay in your family<br>
Have understanding and learning,<br>
And do their duty through the power of understanding,<br>
Just as you’d cross a full river by boat.</p>
