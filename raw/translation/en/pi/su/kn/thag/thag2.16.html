<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc151"></a>There’s a big black woman who looks like a crow.<br>
She broke off thigh-bones, first one then another;<br>
She broke off arm-bones, first one then another;<br>
She broke off a skull like a curd-bowl, and then—<br>
She assembled them all together, and sat down beside them.</p>

That idiot returns to suffering, again and again.<br>
So let one who understands not build up attachments:<br>
May I never again lie with a broken skull!</p>
