<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc375"></a>When I saw the marvels<br>
Of the renowned Gotama,<br>
I didn’t immediately bow to him;<br>
I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc376"></a>Knowing what I was thinking,<br>
The trainer of men spurred me on;<br>
And I was struck with a marvellous inspiration,<br>
That gave me goose-bumps.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc377"></a>Rejecting my petty accomplishments<br>
When I used to be a matted-hair ascetic,<br>
I then went forth,<br>
In the conqueror’s teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc378"></a>I used to be content with sacrifice,<br>
Giving priority to the realm of sensual pleasures,<br>
But later I uprooted desire,<br>
And hatred and also delusion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc379"></a>I know my past life;<br>
My divine eye is clarified;<br>
I have psychic powers, and I know the minds of others;<br>
I have realised the divine ear.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc380"></a>I’ve attained the goal<br>
For the sake of which I went forth<br>
From home life into homelessness—<br>
The ending of all fetters.</p>
