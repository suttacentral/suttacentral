<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc411"></a>Get up, Kātiyāna, and sit!<br>
Don’t sleep too much, be wakeful.<br>
Don’t be lazy, and let the kinsman of the heedless,<br>
The king of death, catch you in his trap.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc412"></a>Like a wave in the mighty ocean,<br>
Birth and old age overwhelm you.<br>
Make a safe island of yourself,<br>
For you have no other shelter.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc413"></a>The teacher has mastered this path,<br>
Which transcends ties, and the fear of birth and old age.<br>
Be heedful all the time,<br>
And devote yourself to dedicated practice.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc414"></a>Be free of your former bonds!<br>
Wearing outer robe, with shaven head, eating almsfood,<br>
Don’t delight in play or sleep,<br>
Devote yourself to <i>jhāna</i>, Kātiyāna.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc415"></a>Practice <i>jhāna</i> and conquer, Kātiyāna,<br>
You’re skilled in the path to security from the yoke.<br>
Attaining unexcelled purity,<br>
You’ll be quenched, like a flame by water.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc416"></a>A lamp with feeble flames<br>
Is bent down by the wind, like a creeper;<br>
Just so, kinsman of Indra,<br>
You shake off Māra, without grasping.<br>
Free of lust for feelings,<br>
Await your time here, cooled.</p>
