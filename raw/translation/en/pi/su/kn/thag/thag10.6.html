<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc577"></a>In order to go on retreat,<br>
A monk should stay in lodgings<br>
That are secluded and quiet,<br>
Frequented by beasts of prey.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc578"></a>Having gathered scraps from rubbish heaps,<br>
Cemeteries and streets,<br>
And making an outer robe from them,<br>
He should wear that coarse robe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc579"></a>Humbling his mind,<br>
A monk should walk for alms<br>
From family to family without exception,<br>
With sense doors guarded, well-restrained .</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc580"></a>He should be content even with coarse food,<br>
Not hoping for lots of flavours.<br>
The mind that is greedy for flavours<br>
Doesn’t delight in <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc581"></a>With few wishes, content,<br>
A sage should live secluded.<br>
Socializing with neither<br>
Householders nor the homeless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc582"></a>He should appear<br>
To be stupid or dumb;<br>
A wise person would not speak overly long<br>
In the midst of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc583"></a>He would not insult anyone,<br>
And would avoid causing harm.<br>
Restrained in accordance with the Pātimokkha,<br>
He would eat in moderation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc584"></a>Skilled in the arising of thought,<br>
He would grasp well the character of the mind.<br>
He would be devoted to practicing<br>
Serenity and insight at the right time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc585"></a>Though endowed with energy and perseverance,<br>
And always devoted to meditation,<br>
A wise person would not be too sure of themselves,<br>
Until they have attained the end of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc586"></a>For a monk who dwells in this way,<br>
Longing for purification,<br>
All his defilements wither away,<br>
And he attains <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
