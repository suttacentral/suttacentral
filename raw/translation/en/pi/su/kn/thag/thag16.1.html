<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc705"></a>“Those that we previously killed,<br>
Whether for sacrifice or for wealth,<br>
Without exception were afraid:<br>
They trembled and squealed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc706"></a>But you aren’t frightened;<br>
Your appearance is becoming more calm:<br>
Why don’t you cry out<br>
In such a fearful situation?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc707"></a>“There isn’t any mental suffering<br>
For one without expectations, village chief.<br>
All fears are left behind<br>
By one whose fetters are ended.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc708"></a>When attachment to life is ended,<br>
In this very life as it is,<br>
There is no fear of death,<br>
It is just like laying down a burden.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc709"></a>I’ve lived the spiritual life well,<br>
And developed the path well, too;<br>
I have no fear of death<br>
It is just like the ending of sickness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc710"></a>I’ve lived the spiritual life well,<br>
And developed the path well, too;<br>
I’ve seen lives seen to be ungratifying,<br>
Like one who has drunk poison, then vomited it out.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc711"></a>One who has gone beyond, without grasping,<br>
Their duty completed, without defilements:<br>
They are content at the end of life,<br>
Just as one freed from execution.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc712"></a>Having realised the supreme Dhamma,<br>
Without needing anything from the whole world,<br>
One doesn’t grieve at death;<br>
It is just like escaping from a burning house.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc713"></a>Whatever has come to pass,<br>
Wherever life is obtained,<br>
There is no-one who can wield power over all that:<br>
So it was said by the great sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc714"></a>Whoever understands this<br>
As it was taught by the Buddha<br>
Doesn’t take hold of any kind of life,<br>
It is just like grabbing a hot iron ball.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc715"></a>It doesn’t occur to me, ‘I had past lives’;<br>
Nor does it occur to me, ‘I will have future lives’.<br>
All conditions will disappear—<br>
Why lament for that?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc716"></a>Seeing in accordance with reality<br>
The bare arising of phenomena,<br>
And the bare continuity of conditions,<br>
There is no fear, village chief.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc717"></a>The world is like grass and wood:<br>
When this is seen with understanding,<br>
Not finding anything to be mine,<br>
Thinking ‘it isn’t mine’, one doesn’t grieve.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc718"></a>I’m fed up with the body;<br>
I don’t need another life.<br>
This body will be broken up,<br>
There won’t be another.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc719"></a>Do what you want<br>
With my corpse.<br>
I won’t be angry or attached<br>
On that account.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc720"></a>When they heard these words,<br>
So astonishing that they gave them goose-bumps,<br>
The young men laid down their swords<br>
And said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc721"></a>“What have you practiced, Venerable?<br>
Or who is your teacher?<br>
Whose instructions do we follow<br>
To gain the sorrowless state?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc722"></a>“All-knowing, all-seeing,<br>
The conqueror is my teacher.<br>
He is a teacher of great compassion,<br>
Healer of the whole world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc723"></a>He taught this Dhamma,<br>
Which leads to the end, unsurpassed.<br>
Following his instructions,<br>
You can gain the sorrowless state.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc724"></a>When the bandits heard the good words of the sage,<br>
They laid down their swords and weapons.<br>
Some refrained from their deeds,<br>
While others chose the going-forth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc725"></a>When they had gone forth in the teaching of the Fortunate One,<br>
They developed the factors of awakening and the spiritual powers,<br>
And being wise, with joyful hearts, happy, their spiritual faculties complete,<br>
They realised the state of <i>nibbāna</i>, the unconditioned.</p>
