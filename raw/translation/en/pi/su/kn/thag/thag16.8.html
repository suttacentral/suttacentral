<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>16.8. Aṅguli­māla</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc866"></a>“Ascetic, you’re walking, but you say ‘I’m standing still’;<br>
And I’m standing still, but you tell me I’m not.<br>
I’m asking you this, ascetic:<br>
Why are you standing still and I’m not?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc867"></a>“Aṅgulimāla, I always stand still—<br>
I’ve given up violence towards all living beings.<br>
But you have no restraint towards living creatures;<br>
That’s why I’m standing still and you’re not.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc868"></a>“It’s a been a long time since an ascetic,<br>
A great sage who I honour, has entered this great forest.<br>
Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,<br>
I’ll discard a thousand evils.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc869"></a>With these words, the bandit hurled his sword and weapons<br>
Down a pit, a cliff, a chasm.<br>
Right there, he venerated the Fortunate One’s feet,<br>
And asked the Buddha for the going-forth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc870"></a>Then the Buddha, the compassionate great sage,<br>
The teacher of the world together with its gods,<br>
Said to him, “Come, monk!”<br>
Just this was enough for him to be a monk.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc871"></a>“Whoever was heedless before,<br>
And afterwards is not,<br>
Lights up the world,<br>
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc872"></a>One whose bad deed<br>
Is blocked by skilful action,<br>
Lights up the world,<br>
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc873"></a>The young monk<br>
Who is devoted to the teaching of the Buddha,<br>
Lights up the world,<br>
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc874"></a>May even my enemies hear a Dhamma talk!<br>
May even my enemies devote themselves to Buddha’s teaching!<br>
May even my enemies associate when they can,<br>
With those who establish people in the Dhamma!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc875"></a>May even my enemies hear Dhamma at suitable times,<br>
From those who speak on acceptance,<br>
Praising acquiescence;<br>
And may they practice accordingly!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc876"></a>They would definitely not harm<br>
Me or anyone else;<br>
But would attain the ultimate peace,<br>
Looking after creatures both firm and fragile.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc877"></a>Irrigators lead water,<br>
Fletchers shape arrows,<br>
Carpenters shape wood;<br>
The disciplined tame themselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc878"></a>Some tame with sticks,<br>
With hooked poles or whips;<br>
But the poised one tamed me<br>
Without rod or sword.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc879"></a>My name is ‘Harmless’,<br>
Though I used to be harmful.<br>
Today my name is truthful,<br>
As I don’t harm anyone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc880"></a>I used to be a bandit,<br>
The notorious Aṅgulimāla.<br>
Swept away in a great flood,<br>
I went to Buddha as a refuge.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc881"></a>I used to have blood on my hands,<br>
The notorious Aṅgulimāla.<br>
See my going for refuge—<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc882"></a>I’ve done many such deeds<br>
As lead to a bad destination.<br>
I’ve experienced the result of my deeds,<br>
So I enjoy my food free of debt.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc883"></a>Fools and unintelligent people<br>
Devote themselves to heedlessness.<br>
But the intelligent protect heedfulness<br>
As their best treasure.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc884"></a>Don’t devote yourself to heedlessness,<br>
Nor delight in sexual intimacy.<br>
If you are heedful and practice <i>jhāna</i><br>
You’ll attain the highest happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc885"></a>It was welcome, not unwelcome,<br>
The advice I got was good.<br>
Of things which are shared,<br>
I encountered the best.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc886"></a>It was welcome, not unwelcome,<br>
The advice I got was good.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc887"></a>In the wilderness, at the foot of a tree,<br>
In mountains, or in caves;<br>
At that time, wherever I stood,<br>
My mind was anxious.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc888"></a>But now I lie down happily and stand up happily,<br>
I live my life happily,<br>
Out of Māra’s reach;<br>
The teacher had compassion for me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc889"></a>I used to belong to the brahman caste,<br>
Highborn on both sides,<br>
Now I’m a son of the Fortunate One,<br>
The teacher, the King of Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc890"></a>I am free of craving, without grasping,<br>
My sense-doors are guarded and well-restrained.<br>
I’ve destroyed the root of misery,<br>
And attained the end of defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc891"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.”</p>
