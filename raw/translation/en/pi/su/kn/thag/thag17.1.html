<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>17.1. Phussa</h1>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc949"></a>Seeing many who inspire confidence,<br>
Personally developed and well-restrained,<br>
The sage Paṇḍarasagotta<br>
Asked the one known as Phussa:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc950"></a>“In future times,<br>
What desire and motivation<br>
And behaviour will people have?<br>
Please answer my question.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc951"></a>“Listen to my words<br>
O sage known as Paṇḍarasa:<br>
And remember them carefully,<br>
I will describe the future.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc952"></a>In the future many will be<br>
Angry and hostile,<br>
Denigrating, stubborn, and treacherous,<br>
Envious, and holding divergent views.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc953"></a>Thinking they understand the profundity of the Dhamma,<br>
They remain on the near shore.<br>
Superficial and disrespectful towards the Dhamma,<br>
They have no respect for one another.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc954"></a>In the future,<br>
Many dangers will arise in the world.<br>
Fools will defile<br>
The Dhamma that has been taught so well.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc955"></a>Though lacking good qualities,<br>
The incompetent, the talkative,<br>
And the unlearned,<br>
Will be powerful in Saṅgha proceedings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc956"></a>Though possessing good qualities,<br>
The competent, the conscientious,<br>
And the unbiased,<br>
Will be weak in Saṅgha proceedings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc957"></a>In the future, fools will accept<br>
Gold and silver,<br>
Fields and property, goats and sheep,<br>
And male and female bonded servants.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc958"></a>Fools looking to find fault in others,<br>
But bereft of virtues themselves,<br>
Will wander about, insolent,<br>
Like cantankerous beasts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc959"></a>They’ll be arrogant,<br>
Wrapped in robes of blue;<br>
Deceitful, obstinate, chatty, caustic,<br>
They’ll wander as if they were noble ones.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc960"></a>With hair sleeked back with oil,<br>
Fickle, their eyes painted with eye-liner,<br>
They’ll travel on the high-road,<br>
Wrapped in robes of ivory color.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc961"></a>They’ll love white clothes,<br>
And they’ll detest the deep-dyed ochre robe,<br>
The banner of the <i>arahants</i>,<br>
Which is worn without disgust by the free.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc962"></a>They’ll want lots of things,<br>
And be lazy, lacking energy;<br>
Weary of the forest,<br>
They’ll stay in villages.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc963"></a>Being unrestrained, they’ll keep company with<br>
Those who obtain lots of things,<br>
And who always enjoy wrong livelihood,<br>
Following their example.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc964"></a>They won’t respect those<br>
Who don’t obtain lots of things,<br>
And they won’t associate with the wise,<br>
Even though they’re very amiable.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc965"></a>Disparaging their own banner,<br>
Which is dyed the colour of copper,<br>
Some will wear the white banner<br>
Of the followers of other religions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc966"></a>Then they’ll have no respect<br>
For the ochre robe;<br>
The monks will not reflect<br>
On the nature of the ochre robe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc967"></a>This awful lack of reflection<br>
Was unthinkable to the elephant,<br>
Who was overcome by suffering,<br>
Pierced by an arrow, and injured.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc968"></a>Then the six-tusked elephant,<br>
Seeing the deep-coloured banner of the <i>arahants</i>,<br>
Straight away spoke these verses<br>
Connected with the goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc969"></a>The impure one<br>
Who will wear the ochre robe<br>
Without taming and truth,<br>
Isn’t worthy of the ochre robe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc970"></a>Whoever has rejected impurities,<br>
Endowed with virtues,<br>
Possessing truth and taming,<br>
They are truly worthy of the ochre robe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc971"></a>Devoid of virtue, unintelligent,<br>
Wild, doing what they like,<br>
Their minds all over the place, indolent<br>
They are not worthy of the ochre robe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc972"></a>Whoever is endowed with virtue,<br>
Free of lust, possessing <i>samādhi</i>,<br>
Their heart’s intention pure,<br>
They are truly worthy of the ochre robe.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc973"></a>The conceited, arrogant fool,<br>
Who has no virtue,<br>
Is worthy of a white robe—<br>
What use is an ochre robe for them?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc974"></a>In the future, monks and nuns<br>
With corrupt hearts, disrespectful,<br>
Will disparage those<br>
With hearts of loving-kindness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc975"></a>Though trained in wearing the robe<br>
By senior monks,<br>
The unintelligent will not listen,<br>
Wild, doing what they like.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc976"></a>With that kind of attitude to training,<br>
Those fools won’t respect each another,<br>
Or take any notice of their mentors,<br>
Like a wild horse with its charioteer.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc977"></a>So, in the future,<br>
This will be the practice<br>
Of monks and nuns,<br>
When the latter days have come.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc978"></a>Before this terrifying future arrives,<br>
Be easy to admonish,<br>
Kind in speech,<br>
And respect one another.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc979"></a>Have hearts of loving-kindness and compassion,<br>
And keep your precepts;<br>
Be energetic, resolute,<br>
And always strong in exertion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc980"></a>Seeing heedlessness as fearful,<br>
And heedfulness as security,<br>
Develop the eight-fold path,<br>
Realising the deathless state.”</p>
