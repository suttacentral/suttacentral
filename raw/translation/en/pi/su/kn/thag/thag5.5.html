<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc335"></a>It was good, how my mother<br>
Spurred me onwards.<br>
When I heard her words,<br>
Advised by my mother,<br>
I became energetic, resolute—<br>
I realised supreme awakening.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc336"></a>I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,<br>
With the three knowledges and the vision of the deathless;<br>
I conquered Namuci’s army,<br>
And now I live without defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc337"></a>The defilements which I had,<br>
Both internally and externally,<br>
Are now all cut off without remainder;<br>
They won’t arise again.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc338"></a>My skilful sister<br>
said this to me:<br>
“Now neither you nor I<br>
Have any entanglements.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc339"></a>Suffering is at an end;<br>
This is the last body<br>
To transmigrate through birth and death:<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
