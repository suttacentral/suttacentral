<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc818"></a>“Your body is perfect, you are radiant,<br>
Handsome, lovely to behold,<br>
Blessed One, you are golden coloured,<br>
Your teeth are pure white, you are full of energy.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc819"></a>The characteristics<br>
Of a handsome man,<br>
The marks of a great man,<br>
Are all in your body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc820"></a>Your eyes are clear, your face is nice,<br>
You are large, upright, and majestic.<br>
In the middle of the Saṅgha of ascetics,<br>
You shine like the sun.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc821"></a>You’re a good-looking monk,<br>
With skin like gold;<br>
With such excellent appearance,<br>
What do you want with the ascetic life?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc822"></a>You’re worthy of being a king,<br>
A wheel-rolling emperor, a bull among heroes,<br>
Victorious in the four directions,<br>
Lord of all India.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc823"></a>Warriors, lords, and kings<br>
Are your followers<br>
You are king above kings and lord of men—<br>
Claim your kingship, Gotama!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc824"></a>“Sela, I <em>am</em> a king,<br>
Said the Blessed one to Sela,<br>
“The unsurpassed king of Dhamma.<br>
By Dhamma I set the wheel rolling,<br>
The wheel which cannot be rolled back.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc825"></a>“You claim to be awakened,”<br>
Said Sela the brahman,<br>
“The unsurpassed king of Dhamma.<br>
‘By Dhamma I set the wheel rolling,’<br>
That is what you say, Gotama.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc826"></a>Who is the Blessed One’s general,<br>
The disciple who follows the teacher?<br>
Who keeps on rolling<br>
The wheel of Dhama you rolled forth?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc827"></a>“I rolled forth the wheel,”<br>
Said the Blessed One to Sela,<br>
“The unexcelled wheel of Dhamma.<br>
Sāriputta, who follows the Tathāgata’s example,<br>
Keeps it rolling on.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc828"></a>What’s to be known is known;<br>
What’s to be developed is developed;<br>
I’ve abandoned what’s to be abandoned;<br>
Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc829"></a>Dispel your doubt in me;<br>
Make up your mind, brahman!<br>
It’s always hard to gain<br>
The sight of Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc830"></a>I am one of those whose appearance<br>
Is always hard to find in this world;<br>
I am a Buddha, brahman,<br>
The unexcelled remover of darts.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc831"></a>Holy, unequalled,<br>
Crusher of Māra’s army;<br>
Having subdued all enemies,<br>
I rejoice, fearing nothing in any direction.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc832"></a>“Listen, sirs, to what,<br>
Is spoken by the seer.<br>
Remover of darts, great hero,<br>
Roaring like a lion in the jungle.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc833"></a>Holy, unequalled,<br>
Crusher of Māra’s army;<br>
Who could see him and not have faith,<br>
Even one whose nature is dark?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc834"></a>Those who wish may follow me;<br>
Those who don’t wish may go.<br>
Right here, I’ll go forth,<br>
In the presence of the glorious wise one.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc835"></a>“If, sir, you adopt<br>
The teaching of the Buddha,<br>
We will also go forth<br>
In the presence of the glorious wise one.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc836"></a>These three hundred brahmans<br>
With hands held in <i>añjalī</i>, ask:<br>
“May we live the holy life<br>
In your presence, Blessed One?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc837"></a>“The holy life is well proclaimed,”<br>
Said the Buddha to Sela,<br>
“Apparent in this very life, without delay,<br>
In which the going forth isn’t in vain,<br>
For one heedful in the training.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc838"></a>“It’s the eighth day, o seer,<br>
Since we went to you for refuge.<br>
In seven days, Blessed One,<br>
We were tamed in your teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc839"></a>You are the Buddha, you are the teacher<br>
You are the sage who has overcome Māra;<br>
You have cut off the underlying tendencies,<br>
And having crossed over yourself, you bring people across.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc840"></a>You have transcended attachments,<br>
Your defilements have been torn apart;<br>
Without grasping, like a lion,<br>
You’ve abandoned fear and dread.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc841"></a>These three hundred monks<br>
Stand with hands in <i>añjalī</i>:<br>
Put out your feet, great hero,<br>
Let these beings of power venerate the teacher.”</p>
