<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc981"></a>“A mindful person is like one of good conduct,<br>
Or like one who is peaceful;<br>
A heedful person is like one of good intentions,<br>
who is practicing <i>jhāna</i>;<br>
Happy inside, possessing <i>samādhi</i>,<br>
Solitary, contented; that is what they call a monk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc982"></a>When eating fresh or dried food,<br>
One shouldn’t be overly satisfied.<br>
A monk should wander mindfully,<br>
With unfilled belly, taking limited food.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc983"></a>Four or five mouthfuls before you’re full,<br>
Drink some water;<br>
This is enough to live comfortably<br>
For a resolute monk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc984"></a>Covered by a suitable robe,<br>
Which is for this purpose;<br>
This is enough to live comfortably<br>
For a resolute monk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc985"></a>When sitting cross-legged,<br>
The rain doesn’t fall on the knees;<br>
This is enough to live comfortably<br>
For a resolute monk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc986"></a>When you’ve seen happiness as suffering,<br>
And suffering as a dart,<br>
You know there’s no difference between them—<br>
With what are you bound to the world?<br>
What would you become?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc987"></a>When you think, ‘May I not associate with people of bad wishes,<br>
Lazy, lacking energy<br>
With little learning, disrespectful’—<br>
With what are you bound to the world?<br>
What would you become?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc988"></a>A wise person who is learned,<br>
Endowed with virtues,<br>
Devoted to serenity of heart—<br>
Let them stand at the head.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc989"></a>Whoever is devoted to proliferation,<br>
A wild animal delighting in proliferation,<br>
Is deprived of <i>nibbāna</i>,<br>
The unexcelled safety from the yoke.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc990"></a>Whoever has given up proliferation,<br>
Delighting in the path free of proliferation,<br>
Is blessed with <i>nibbāna</i>,<br>
The unexcelled safety from the yoke.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc991"></a>Whether in the village or in the wilderness,<br>
In lands low or high,<br>
Wherever <i>arahants</i> live<br>
Is a delightful place.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc992"></a>The wilderness is delightful!<br>
Where most people find no delight,<br>
Those who are free of lust delight there,<br>
As they are not seeking sensual pleasures.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc993"></a>When you see someone who sees your faults,<br>
A wise person who rebukes you,<br>
You should stick close to such an intelligent person,<br>
As if they were revealing some hidden treasure.<br>
Sticking close to such a person, <br>
Things get better, not worse.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc994"></a>You should advise, you should admonish;<br>
You should curb rudeness;<br>
For such a person is loved by the mindful,<br>
Not loved by the unmindful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc995"></a>The Blessed One, the Buddha, the seer<br>
Was teaching Dhamma to another.<br>
While Dhamma was being taught<br>
I listened attentively, to understand the meaning—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc996"></a>My listening wasn’t wasted,<br>
I’m liberated, without defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc997"></a>Not for knowledge of past lives,<br>
Nor even for clairvoyance;<br>
Not for psychic powers, or reading the minds of others,<br>
Nor for knowing people’s passing away and being reborn;<br>
Not for purifying the power of clairaudience,<br>
Did I have any resolve.”</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc998"></a>“His only shelter is at the foot of a tree;<br>
With shaved head, wrapped in the outer robe,<br>
The senior monk who is foremost in wisdom,<br>
Upatissa himself practices <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc999"></a>Entering a meditation state without thought,<br>
A disciple of the Buddha<br>
Is at that moment blessed<br>
With noble silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1000"></a>Just like a rocky mountain<br>
Is unshakable and firmly grounded;<br>
So when delusion ends,<br>
A monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1001"></a>“To the blameless man<br>
Who is always seeking purity,<br>
Even a hair-tip of evil<br>
Seems the size of a cloud.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1002"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I will lay down this body,<br>
Aware and mindful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1003"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Like a worker waiting for their wages.”</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1004"></a>“Both before and after<br>
It’s death, not the deathless,<br>
Practice, don’t perish—<br>
Don’t let the moment pass you by.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1005"></a>Just like a frontier city,<br>
Guarded inside and out,<br>
So you should ward yourselves<br>
Don’t let the moment pass you by.<br>
Those who pass up the moment<br>
Grieve when they end up in hell.”</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1006"></a>“Calm and quiet, <br>
Wise in counsel, not restless;<br>
He shakes off bad qualities<br>
As the wind shakes leaves off a tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1007"></a>Calm and quiet, <br>
Wise in counsel, not restless;<br>
He plucks off bad qualities<br>
As the wind plucks leaves off a tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1008"></a>Calm and sorrowless,<br>
Clear and undisturbed,<br>
Of good virtue and intelligent:<br>
You should put an end to suffering.”</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1009"></a>“Some householders, and even some of those gone forth,<br>
Are not to be trusted.<br>
Even some who were good later become bad;<br>
While some who were bad become good.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1010"></a>Sensual desire, ill-will<br>
Dullness &amp; drowsiness,<br>
Restlessness, and doubt:<br>
These are the five mental stains for a monk.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1011"></a>Whoever’s <i>samādhi</i> does not waver,<br>
Regardless of whether or not<br>
They receive honours,<br>
Is one who lives heedfully.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1012"></a>They regularly practice <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
With subtle insight into views;<br>
Delighting in the end of grasping,<br>
They are said to be a good person.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1013"></a>Ocean, earth,<br>
Mountains, wind—<br>
These cannot compare<br>
With the teacher’s magnificent liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1014"></a>He is the senior monk who keeps the Wheel of Dhamma rolling,<br>
Possessing great knowledge and <i>samādhi</i>.<br>
Like earth, like water, like fire,<br>
He is neither attracted nor repelled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="35"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1015"></a>He has attained the perfection of wisdom,<br>
He has great intelligence and great discernment;<br>
He is not stupid, but appears stupid;<br>
He always wanders, quenched.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="36"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1016"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="37"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1017"></a>Strive on with heedfulness:<br>
This is my advice.<br>
Come, now I’ll realise <i>nibbāna</i>,<br>
I am liberated in every way.”</p>
