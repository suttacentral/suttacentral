<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc295"></a>I am known as “Fortunate Rāhula”,<br>
Because I’m endowed in both ways:<br>
I am the son of the Buddha,<br>
And I have the vision of the Dhammas.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc296"></a>Since my defilements have ended,<br>
Since there is no more being reborn in any state of existence—<br>
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,<br>
With the three knowledges and the vision of the deathless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc297"></a>Blinded by sensual pleasures, trapped in a net,<br>
They are smothered over by craving,<br>
Bound by the Kinsman of the Negligent,<br>
Like a fish caught in a funnel-net trap.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc298"></a>Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,<br>
Having cut Māra’s bond,<br>
Having pulled out craving, roots and all:<br>
I’ve become cool, and realized <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
