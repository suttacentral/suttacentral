<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc510"></a>When I first saw the teacher,<br>
Who was free of fear from any direction,<br>
I was struck with awe,<br>
Since I’d seen the best of men.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc511"></a>If you have the good luck<br>
To find such a teacher,<br>
But you push it all away,<br>
You’ll lose your chance.</p> 
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc512"></a>Then I left behind my children and wife,<br>
My riches and my grain;<br>
I cut off my hair and beard,<br>
And went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc513"></a>Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood,<br>
My sense faculties well-restrained,<br>
Paying homage to the Buddha,<br>
I dwelt undefeated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc514"></a>Then a resolve occurred to me,<br>
My heart’s truest wish:<br>
I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a moment,<br>
Until the dart of craving was pulled out.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc515"></a>As I dwell like this,<br>
See my energy and striving!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc516"></a>I know my past life;<br>
My divine eye is clarified;<br>
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,<br>
Liberated, without attachments.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc517"></a>Then, at the end of the night,<br>
As the rising of the sun drew near,<br>
All craving was dried up,<br>
So I sat down cross-legged.</p>
