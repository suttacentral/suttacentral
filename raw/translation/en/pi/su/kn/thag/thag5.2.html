<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc320"></a>If a person, wishing for a certain outcome,<br>
Applies themseves to a misguided endeavor,<br>
And they don’t achieve what they have practiced for,<br>
They say: “That’s a sign of my bad luck.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc321"></a>When a misfortune has been plucked out and conquered,<br>
To give it up in part would be like the losing throw of the dice;<br>
But to give up everything would be as if one was blind,<br>
Not discerning the even and the uneven.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc322"></a>You should only say what you would do;<br>
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.<br>
The wise will recognize<br>
One who talks without doing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc323"></a>Just like a glorious flower<br>
That’s colourful but lacks fragrance;<br>
So is well-spoken speech fruitless<br>
For one not acting in accordance.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc324"></a>Just like a glorious flower<br>
Is both colourful and fragrant,<br>
So is well-spoken speech fruitful<br>
For one who acts in accordance.</p>
