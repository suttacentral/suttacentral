<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc453"></a>Though this two-legged body is dirty and stinking,<br>
Full of different carcasses,<br>
And oozing from various places,<br>
Still it is cherished.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc454"></a>Like a hidden deer by a trick,<br>
Like a fish by a hook,<br>
Like a monkey by tar—<br>
They trap an unawakened person.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc455"></a>Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,<br>
And touches, all delighting the mind.<br>
These five kinds of sensual pleasure<br>
Are seen in a woman’s body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc456"></a>Those unawakened people, their minds full of lust,<br>
Who pursue those women;<br>
They swell the horrors of the charnel ground,<br>
Piling up more rebirth into various states of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc457"></a>The one who avoids them,<br>
Like a snake’s head with a foot,<br>
Mindful, he transcends<br>
Attachment to the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc458"></a>Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures,<br>
And recognizing renunciation as safety,<br>
I’ve escaped all sensual pleasures,<br>
And attained the end of defilements.</p>
