<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc920"></a>While the ascetic practiced <i>jhāna</i>,<br>
Seated in seclusion, unified,<br>
In the forest full of flowers,<br>
This thought came to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc921"></a>“The behaviour of the monks<br>
These days seems different<br>
From when the lord of the world,<br>
The best of men, was still here.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc922"></a>Their robes were only for covering the private parts,<br>
And protection from the cold and wind;<br>
They ate in moderation,<br>
Content with whatever they were offered.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc923"></a>Whether refined or rough,<br>
Little or much,<br>
They ate only for sustenance,<br>
Without greed or gluttony.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc924"></a>They weren’t so very eager,<br>
For the requisites of life,<br>
Such as tonics and other necessities,<br>
As they were for the end of defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc925"></a>In the wilderness, at the foot of trees,<br>
In caves and caverns,<br>
Committed to seclusion,<br>
They lived with that as their final goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc926"></a>They were used to simple things, and were easy to look after,<br>
Gentle, their hearts not stubborn,<br>
Unsullied, not talkative,<br>
Their minds were intent on the goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc927"></a>In this way they inspired confidence,<br>
 In their movements, eating, and practice;<br>
Their deportment was smooth<br>
As a stream of oil.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc928"></a>With the ending of all defilements,<br>
Those senior monks have now realised <i>nibbāna</i>;<br>
They were great meditators and great benefactors—<br>
There are few like them today.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc929"></a>With the ending<br>
Of good principles and understanding,<br>
The conqueror’s teaching,<br>
Full of all excellent qualities, has fallen apart.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc930"></a>This is the season<br>
For bad principles and defilements.<br>
Those who are ready for seclusion<br>
Are all that’s left of the true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc931"></a>As they grow, the defilements<br>
Possess many people;<br>
They play with fools, I believe,<br>
Like demons with the mad.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc932"></a>Overcome by defilements,<br>
They run here and there<br>
Among the causes for defilement,<br>
As if they had declared war on themselves.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc933"></a>Having abandoned true Dhamma,<br>
They argue with each other;<br>
Following wrong views<br>
They think, ‘This is better.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc934"></a>They cut off their wealth,<br>
Children, and wife to go forth;<br>
But then they do what they shouldn’t,<br>
For the sake of a measly spoon of alms-food.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc935"></a>They eat until their bellies are full,<br>
And then they lie to sleep on their backs.<br>
When they wake again, they keep on talking,<br>
The kind of talk that the teacher criticized.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc936"></a>Valuing all the arts and crafts,<br>
They train themselves in them;<br>
Not being calm inside,<br>
They think, ‘This is the purpose of the ascetic life’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc937"></a>They provide clay, oil, and talcum powder,<br>
Water, lodgings, and food<br>
For householders,<br>
Expecting more in return.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc938"></a>As well as tooth-picks, wood-apples,<br>
Flowers, food to eat,<br>
Well-cooked alms-food,<br>
Mangoes and myrobalans.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc939"></a>In medicine they are like doctors,<br>
In business like householders,<br>
In decoration like prostitutes,<br>
In sovereignty like lords.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc940"></a>Cheats, frauds,<br>
False witnesses, sly:<br>
Using multiple plans,<br>
They enjoy material things.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc941"></a>Pursuing shams, contrivances, and plans,<br>
By this means<br>
They accumulate a lot of wealth<br>
For the sake of their livelihood.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc942"></a>They assemble the community<br>
For business rather than Dhamma.<br>
They teach the Dhamma to others<br>
For gain, not for the goal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc943"></a>Those outside the Saṅgha<br>
Quarrel over the Saṅgha’s property.<br>
They’re shameless, and do not care<br>
That they live on someone else’s property.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc944"></a>Some who have a shaven head and wear the outer robe,<br>
Are not devoted to practice,<br>
But wish only to be honored,<br>
Infatuated with property and reverence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc945"></a>When things have come to this,<br>
It’s not easy these days<br>
To realise what has not yet been realised,<br>
Or to preserve what has been realised.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc946"></a>A person with mindfulness established<br>
Could walk without shoes<br>
Even in a thorny place;<br>
That is how a sage should walk in the village.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc947"></a>Remembering the meditators of old,<br>
And recollecting their conduct;<br>
Even in the latter days,<br>
It is still possible to realise the deathless.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc948"></a>That is what the ascetic, whose faculties<br>
Were fully developed, said in the <i>sāla</i> tree grove.<br>
The holy man, the sage, realised <i>nibbāna</i>:<br>
Ending more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
