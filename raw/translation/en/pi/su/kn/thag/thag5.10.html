<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc360"></a>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They’re as far from true Dhamma,<br>
As the earth is from the sky.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc361"></a>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They decline in the true Dhamma,<br>
Like the moon in the waning fortnight.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc362"></a>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They wither away in the true Dhamma,<br>
Like a fish in too little water.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc363"></a>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They don’t thrive in the true Dhamma,<br>
Like a rotten seed in a field.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc364"></a>But one with contended mind<br>
Who listens to the conqueror’s teachings—<br>
Having ended all defilements,<br>
Having witnessed the unshakable,<br>
Having arrived at the highest peace—<br>
They realize <i>nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
