<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc494"></a>Don’t get involved in lots of work,<br>
Avoid people, and don’t try to get more requisites.<br>
If you’re eager and greedy for flavours,<br>
You’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc495"></a>They know that this really is a bog,<br>
This homage and veneration among respectable families.<br>
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,<br>
And hard for a bad man to give up.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc496"></a>Your deeds aren’t bad<br>
Because of what others do.<br>
You yourself should not do bad,<br>
For people have deeds as their kin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc497"></a>You’re not a criminal because of what someone else says,<br>
And you’re not a sage because of what someone else says;<br>
But as you know yourself,<br>
So the gods will know you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc498"></a>Others don’t understand,<br>
That here we come to an end.<br>
Those who do understand this<br>
Settle their quarrels.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc499"></a>A wise person lives on,<br>
Even after their wealth is lost;<br>
But without gaining wisdom,<br>
Even a wealthy person doesn’t really live.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc500"></a>All is heard with the ear,<br>
All is seen with the eye;<br>
The wise would not think that all that is seen and heard<br>

Is worthy of rejection.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc501"></a>Though you have eyes, be as if blind;<br>
Though you have ears, be as if deaf,<br>
Though you have wisdom, be as if stupid,<br>
Though you have strength, be as if feeble.<br>
Then, when the goal has been realised,<br>
You may lie on your death-bed.</p>
