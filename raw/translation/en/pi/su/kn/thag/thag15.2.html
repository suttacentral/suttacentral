<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc689"></a>An person who has become awakened as a human being,<br>
Self-tamed, with <i>samādhi</i>,<br>
Following the spiritual path,<br>
Delights in peace of mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc690"></a>Revered by people,<br>
Gone beyond all things,<br>
Even the gods revere him;<br>
So I’ve heard from the Arahant.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc691"></a>He has transcended all fetters,<br>
And escaped from entanglements,<br>
Delighting in the renunciation of sensual pleasures,<br>
He is liberated like gold from stone.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc692"></a>That elephant outshines all,<br>
As the Himālaya outshines other mountains.<br>
Of all those named “elephant”,<br>
He is truly named, and unsurpassed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc693"></a>I’ll extol the elephant to you,<br>
For he does nothing wrong.<br>
The elephant’s front two feet <br>
Are gentleness and harmlessness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc694"></a>Mindfulness and awareness<br>
Are the elephant’s other feet.<br>
Faith is the great elephant’s trunk,<br>
And equanimity is the white tusks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc695"></a>Mindfulness is his neck, his head is understanding—<br>
The investigation and reflection on phenomena—<br>
His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma,<br>
His tail is seclusion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc696"></a>Practicing <i>jhāna</i>, delighting in the breath,<br>
Serene inside himself.<br>
The elephant is serene when walking,<br>
The elephant is serene when standing,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc697"></a>The elephant is serene when lying down,<br>
And when sitting, the elephant is serene.<br>
The elephant is restrained everywhere:<br>
This is the accomplishment of the elephant.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc698"></a>He eats blameless things,<br>
He doesn’t eat blameworthy things.<br>
When he gets food and clothes,<br>
He avoids storing them up.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc699"></a>Having cut off all bonds,<br>
Fetters large and small,<br>
Wherever he goes,<br>
He goes without longing</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc700"></a>Just as a white lotus,<br>
Fragrant and delightful,<br>
Is born in water and grows there,<br>
But the water does not stick to it;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc701"></a>So the Buddha is born in the world,<br>
And lives in the world,<br>
But the world does not stick to him,<br>
As the water does not stick to the lotus.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc702"></a>A great blazing fire<br>
Dies down when the fuel runs out;<br>
When the coals have gone out<br>
It’s said to be “quenched”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc703"></a>This simile is taught by the discerning<br>
To express the meaning clearly.<br>
Great elephants will understand<br>
What the elephant taught the elephant.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc704"></a>Free of desire, free of hatred,<br>
Free of delusion, without defilements,<br>
The elephant, abandoning their body,<br>
Realises <i>nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
