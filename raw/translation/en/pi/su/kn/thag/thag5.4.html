<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc330"></a>My mentor helped me to learn,<br>
Hoping that I would practice those teachings;<br>
Aspiring for the deathless,<br>
I’ve done what was to be done.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc331"></a>I’ve arrived at the Dhamma,<br>
And witnessed it for myself, not based on hearsay.<br>
With purified knowledge, free of doubt,<br>
I declare it in your presence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc332"></a>I know my past life;<br>
My divine eye is clarified;<br>
I’ve realized my own true goal,<br>
The Buddha’s instruction is fulfilled.</p>

I have learned your teachings well.<br>
All my defilements are ended;<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc334"></a>You advised me in noble ways;<br>
Compassionate, you helped teach me;<br>
Your instruction was not in vain—<br>
I, your student, am fully trained.</p>
