<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>15.1. Aññā­sikoṇ­ḍañña</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc673"></a>“My confidence grew<br>
As I heard the Dhamma, so full of flavor.<br>
Dispassion was the Dhamma that was taught,<br>
Without any grasping at all.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc674"></a>“There are many pretty things<br>
In the circle of this earth;<br>
They disturb one’s thoughts, I believe,<br>
Beautiful, provoking lust.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc675"></a>Just as a rain cloud would settle<br>
The dust blown up by the wind;<br>
So thoughts settle down<br>
When seen with understanding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc676"></a>All conditions are impermanent—<br>
When this is seen with understanding,<br>
One turns away from suffering:<br>
This is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc677"></a>All conditions are suffering—<br>
When this is seen with understanding,<br>
One turns away from suffering:<br>
This is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc678"></a>All phenomena are not-self—<br>
When this is seen with understanding,<br>
One turns away from suffering:<br>
This is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc679"></a>The senior monk Koṇḍañña, who was awakened<br>
Right after the Buddha, is keenly energetic.<br>
He has abandoned birth and death,<br>
And has perfected the spiritual life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc680"></a>There are floods, snares, and strong posts,<br>
And a mountain hard to crack;<br>
Snapping the posts and snares,<br>
Breaking the mountain so hard to break,<br>
Crossing over to the far shore,<br>
One practicing <i>jhāna</i> is freed from Māra’s bonds.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc681"></a>A haughty and fickle monk,<br>
Relying on bad friends,<br>
Sinks down in the great flood,<br>
Overcome by a wave.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc682"></a>But one who is humble and stable,<br>
Controlled, with senses restrained,<br>
Wise, with good friends,<br>
Would put an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc683"></a>With knobbly knees,<br>
Thin, with veins matted on his skin,<br>
Eating and drinking in moderation—<br>
This person’s spirit is undaunted.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc684"></a>Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes<br>
In the awesome wilderness;<br>
One should mindfully endure,<br>
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc685"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Like a worker waiting for their wages.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc686"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Aware and mindful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc687"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc688"></a>I’ve attained the goal<br>
For the sake of which I went forth<br>
From home life into homelessness—<br>
What use do I have for students?”</p>
