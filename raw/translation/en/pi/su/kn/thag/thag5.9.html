<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc355"></a>I’ll cage you, mind,<br>
Like an elephant in a stockade.<br>
Born of the flesh, that net of sensual pleasures,<br>
I won’t urge you to do bad.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc356"></a>Caged, you won’t escape,<br>
Like an elephant who can’t find an open gate.<br>
Demon-mind, you won’t wander again and again,<br>
Bullying, and loving to do bad.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc357"></a>Just as a strong trainer with a hook,<br>
Takes a wild, newly captured elephant<br>
And wins it over against its will,<br>
So I’ll win you over.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc358"></a>Just as a fine charioteer, skilled in the taming<br>
Of fine horses, tames a thoroughbred,<br>
So I’ll tame you,<br>
Firmly established in the five powers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc359"></a>I’ll bind you with mindfulness,<br>
I’m committed to taming you;<br>
Restrained by harnessed energy,<br>
Mind, you won’t go far from here.</p>
