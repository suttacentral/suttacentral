<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc597"></a>“Like an <i>ujjuhāna</i>-bird in the rainy season,<br>
Child, is there benefit for you in the grove?<br>
The city of Verambhā is delightful for you—<br>
Seclusion is for meditators.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc598"></a>“Just as the wind in Verambhā<br>
Scatters the clouds during the rainy-season,<br>
So the city scatters<br>
My perceptions connected with seclusion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc599"></a>It’s all black and born of an egg—<br>
The crow that lives in the charnel ground<br>
Rouses my mindfulness,<br>
Based on dispassion for the body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc600"></a>Not protected by others,<br>
Nor protecting others:<br>
Such a monk sleeps happily,<br>
Without longing for sensual pleasures.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc601"></a>The water is clear and the gorges are wide,<br>
Monkeys and deer are all around;<br>
Festooned with dewy moss,<br>
These rocky crags delight me!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc602"></a>I’ve dwelt in the wilderness,<br>
In caves and caverns,<br>
And remote lodgings,<br>
Frequented by beasts of prey.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc603"></a>‘May these beings be killed! May they be slaughtered!<br>
May they suffer!’—<br>
I’m not aware of having any such<br>
Ignoble, hateful intentions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc604"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc605"></a>I’ve attained the goal<br>
For the sake of which I went forth<br>
From home life into homelessness—<br>
The ending of all fetters.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc606"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Like a worker waiting for their wages.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc607"></a>I don’t long for death;<br>
I don’t long for life;<br>
I await my time,<br>
Aware and mindful.”</p>
