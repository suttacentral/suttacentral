<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1018"></a>“A wise person would not make friends<br>
With a slanderous or hostile person,<br>
With a miser, or one who delights in the misfortunes of others;<br>
Association with a bad person is harmful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1019"></a>The wise would make friends <br>
With the faithful, the pleasant,<br>
Those with understanding, who are learned;<br>
Association with a good person is blessed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1020"></a>See this fancy puppet,<br>
A heap of sores, a composite body,<br>
Diseased, obsessed over,<br>
Having no lasting stability.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1021"></a>See this fancy shape,<br>
With its gems and earrings;<br>
It is bones wrapped with skin,<br>
Made pretty by its clothes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1022"></a>Rouged feet<br>
And powdered face<br>
Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1023"></a>Hair in eight braids<br>
And eyeliner applied,<br>
Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1024"></a>Like a newly decorated make-up box,<br>
The disgusting body all adorned<br>
 Is enough to delude a fool,<br>
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1025"></a>Gotama is learned, a brilliant speaker,<br>
The attendant to the Buddha.<br>
Unfettered, with burden put aside,<br>
He lies down to sleep.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1026"></a>Unfettered, his defilements have ended,<br>
He has transcended attachments, and has attained <i>nibbāna</i>.<br>
He bears his final body,<br>
Gone beyond birth and death.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1027"></a>Gotama, in whom the teachings of the Buddha,<br>
The Kinsman of the Sun, are established,<br>
Stands on the path<br>
Leading to <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1028"></a>I learned 82,000 from the Buddha,<br>
And 2,000 from the monks;<br>
These 84,000<br>
Are the teachings I have memorized.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1029"></a>A person of little learning<br>
Ages like an ox—<br>
Their flesh grows,<br>
But their wisdom doesn’t.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1030"></a>A learned person who, on account of their learning,<br>
Looks down on someone of little learning,<br>
Seems to me like<br>
A blind man holding a lamp.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1031"></a>You should stay close to a learned person—<br>
Don’t lose what you’ve learned.<br>
It is the root of the spiritual life,<br>
So you should memorize the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1032"></a>Knowing the sequence and meaning of the teaching,<br>
Skilled in the interpretation of terms,<br>
He makes sure it is well memorized,<br>
And then examines the meaning.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1033"></a>Accepting the teachings, he becomes enthusiastic;<br>
Making an effort, he scrutinizes the Dhamma;<br>
Striving at the right time,<br>
He is serene inside himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1034"></a>If you want to understand the Dhamma,<br>
You should associate with the sort of person<br>
Who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,<br>
A wise disciple of the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1035"></a>A monk who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,<br>
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,<br>
Is a visionary for the entire world,<br>
Venerable, and learned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1036"></a>Delighting in Dhamma, enjoying Dhamma,<br>
Reflecting on Dhamma,<br>
Recollecting Dhamma,<br>
He doesn’t decline in the true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1037"></a>When your body is pampered and heavy,<br>
While your remaining time is running out;<br>
Greedy for physical pleasure,<br>
How can you find happiness as an ascetic?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1038"></a>Every direction is unclear!<br>
The Dhamma does not occur to me!<br>
With the passing of our good friend,<br>
It all seems dark.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1039"></a>If your friend has passed away,<br>
And your teacher is past and gone,<br>
There’s no friend like<br>
Mindfulness of the body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc1040"></a>The old have passed away,<br>
And I don’t get on with the new.<br>
Today I meditate alone<br>
Like a bird snug in its nest.”</p>
