<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc473"></a>I was an only child,<br>
Loved by my mother and father.<br>
They had me by practising<br>
Many prayers and observances.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc474"></a>Out of compassion,<br>
Wishing me well and seeking my welfare,<br>
My mother and father<br>
Took me up to the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc475"></a>“We had this son with difficulty;<br>
He is delicate, and has grown up in comfort.<br>
We offer him to you, Lord,<br>
To attend upon the conqueror.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc476"></a>The teacher, having accepted me,<br>
Declared to Ānanda:<br>
“Quickly give him the going-forth—<br>
This one will be a thoroughbred.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc477"></a>After he, the teacher, had sent me forth,<br>
The conqueror entered his dwelling.<br>
Before the sun set,<br>
My mind was liberated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc478"></a>The teacher didn’t neglect me;<br>
When he came out from seclusion,<br>
He said: “Come Bhadda!”<br>
That was my full ordination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc479"></a>At seven years old<br>
I received full ordination.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges;<br>
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!</p>
