<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<h1>16.9. Anu­ruddha</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc892"></a>Leaving my mother and father behind,<br>
As well as sisters, kinsmen, and brothers;<br>
Abandoning the five kinds of sensual pleasures,<br>
Anuruddha practices <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc893"></a>Surrounded by song and dance,<br>
Awakened by cymbals and gongs,<br>
He did not find purification,<br>
While delighting in Māra’s domain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc894"></a>But he has gone beyond all that,<br>
And delights in the teaching of the Buddha.<br>
Having crossed over the entire flood,<br>
Anuruddha practices <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc895"></a>Sights, sounds, tastes, smells;<br>
Touches that please the mind.<br>
Having crossed over these as well,<br>
Anuruddha practices <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc896"></a>The sage returned from alms-round,<br>
Alone, without companion.<br>
Seeking rags from the dust heap,<br>
Anuruddha is without defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc897"></a>The thoughtful sage<br>
Selected rags from the dust heap;<br>
He picked them up, washed, dyed, and wore them;<br>
Anuruddha is without defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc898"></a>The principles of someone<br>
Who has many wishes and is not content,<br>
Who socializes and is conceited,<br>
Are wicked and corrupted.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc899"></a>But someone who is mindful, of few wishes,<br>
Content and untroubled,<br>
Delighting in seclusion, joyful,<br>
Always resolute and energetic;</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc900"></a>Their principles are skilful,<br>
Leading to awakening;<br>
They are without defilements—<br>
So it was said by the great sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc901"></a>Knowing my thought,<br>
The world’s unsurpassed teacher<br>
Came up to me in his mind-made body,<br>
Using his psychic powers.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc902"></a>When I had that thought<br>
He taught me more.<br>
The Buddha, delighting in freedom from proliferation,<br>
Taught it to me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc903"></a>Understanding the Dhamma,<br>
I lived happily in the teaching.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc904"></a>For the last fifty-five years<br>
I have not lain down to sleep;<br>
Twenty-five years have passed<br>
Since drowsiness was uprooted.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc905"></a>The poised one, with steady heart,<br>
Was not breathing;<br>
Imperturbable, committed to peace,<br>
The seer has realised <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc906"></a>With a positive mind<br>
He put up with painful feelings;<br>
The liberation of his heart<br>
Was like the quenching of a lamp.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc907"></a>Now these touches and the other four<br>
Are the last to be experienced by the sage;<br>
Nor will there be other mental phenomena<br>
Since the Buddha realised <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc908"></a>Weaver of the web, now there are no future lives<br>
In the company of gods.<br>
Transmigration through births is finished,<br>
Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc909"></a>Whoever in a moment knows the thousand-fold world,<br>
Together with the Brahmā realm;<br>
That monk, a master of psychic powers,<br>
Knowing the passing away and rebirth of beings,<br>
Sees even the gods at that time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc910"></a>In the past I was Annabhāra,<br>
A poor carrier of fodder.<br>
I made an offering<br>
To the renowned ascetic, Upariṭṭha.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc911"></a>Then I was born in the Sakyan clan,<br>
Where I was known as “Anuruddha”.<br>
Surrounded by song and dance,<br>
I was awakened by cymbals and gongs.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc912"></a>Then I saw the Buddha<br>
The teacher, without fear from any direction;<br>
Filling my mind with confidence in him,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc913"></a>I know my past life,<br>
Where I used to live—<br>
I was born as Sakka,<br>
And stayed among the Tāvatiṃsa gods.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc914"></a>Seven times I was a king of men<br>
Ruling a kingdom,<br>
Victorious in the four directions,<br>
Lord of all India.<br>
Without violence or sword,<br>
I governed by principle.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc915"></a>Seven here, seven there,<br>
For fourteen transmigrations<br>
I remember my past lives;<br>
At that time I stayed in the realm of the gods.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc916"></a>I have gained complete tranquillity<br>
In <i>samādhi</i> with five factors;<br>
Peaceful, serene,<br>
My divine eye is purified.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc917"></a>Steady in <i>jhāna</i> with five factors,<br>
I know the passing away and rebirth of beings,<br>
Their coming and going,<br>
Their lives in this state and that.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc918"></a>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
The heavy burden is laid down,<br>
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn in any state of existence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc919"></a>In the Vajjian village of Veḷuva,<br>
At the end of life,<br>
Beneath a thicket of bamboos,<br>
I’ll realise <i>nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
