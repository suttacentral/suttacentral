<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc487"></a>I broke the reeds off with my hands,<br>
Made a hut, and stayed there.<br>
So I became known as “Reed-breaker”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc488"></a>But now it’s not appropriate<br>
For me to break reeds with my hands.<br>
The training rules have been laid down for us<br>
By Gotama the renowned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc489"></a>Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,<br>
Didn’t see the disease in its entirety.<br>
But now I have seen the disease,<br>
Because I practised what was taught by the one beyond the gods.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc490"></a>Gotama travelled by that straight road;<br>
The same path travelled by Vipassī,<br>
The same path as Sikhī, Vessabhū,<br>
Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc491"></a>By these seven Buddhas, who plunged into the ending,<br>
Free of craving, without grasping,<br>
Having become Dhamma, poised,<br>
This Dhamma was taught,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc492"></a>Out of compassion for living beings—<br>
Suffering, origin, path,<br>
And cessation, the ending of suffering.<br>
In these four noble truths,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="verse-num-sc" id="verse-num-sc493"></a>Suffering is stopped,<br>
This endless transmigration.<br>
When the body has broken up,<br>
And life has come to an end,<br>
There is no more rebirth into any state of existence:<br>
I’m well-liberated in every way.</p>
