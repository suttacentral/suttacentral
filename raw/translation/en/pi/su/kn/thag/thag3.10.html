<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>

Today you have none.<br>
What’s yours is yours alone;<br>
I’ve done nothing wrong.</p>

So I have seen.<br>
People’s passions wax and wane:<br>
Why should a sage grow old worrying about that?</p>

Bit by bit, in this family or that.<br>
I’ll walk for alms,<br>
For my legs are strong.</p>
