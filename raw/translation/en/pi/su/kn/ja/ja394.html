<p>“Oil and butter,” etc.—The Master told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. Finding that he was greedy the Master said to him, “This is not the first time you are greedy: once before through greed in Benares you were not satisfied with carcases of elephants, oxen, horses and men; and in hopes of getting better food you went to the forest;” and so he told an old tale.</p>
<p>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a quail and lived in the forest on rude grass and seeds. At the time there was in Benares a greedy crow who, not content with carcases of elephants and other animals, went to the forest in hopes of better food: eating wild fruits there he saw the Bodhisatta and thinking “This quail is very fat: I fancy he eats sweet food, I will ask <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en195"></a> him of his food and eating it become fat myself,” he perched on a bough above the Bodhisatta. The Bodhisatta <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi313"></a>, without being asked, gave him greeting and spoke the first stanza—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Oil and butter are your victuals, nuncle; rich your food, I trow:<br>
Tell me then what is the reason of your leanness, master crow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearing his words the crow spoke three stanzas—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>I dwell in midst of many foes, my heart goes pit-a-pat<br>
In terror as I seek my food: how can a crow be fat?</p>
<p>Crows spend their lives in fear, their wits for mischief ever keen;<br>
The bits they pick are not enough; good quail, that’s why I’m lean.</p>
<p>Rude grass and seeds are all your food: there’s little richness there:<br>
Then tell me why you’re fat, good quail, on such a scanty fare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke these stanzas, explaining the reason of his fatness—</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>I have content and easy mind, short distances to go,<br>
I live on anything I get, and so I’m fat, good crow.</p>
<p>Content of mind, and happiness with little care of heart,<br>
A standard easily attained: that life’s the better part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi314"></a>After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths, and identified the Birth—At the end of the Truths the Brother was established in the fruition of the First Path: “At that time the crow was the greedy Brother, the quail was myself.”</p>
