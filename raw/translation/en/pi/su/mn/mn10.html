<h1>The Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation </h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">This is what I heard—​</span> At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, where they have a city called Kammāsadhamma. There the Buddha addressed the monastics: “Monastics!” “Venerable sir”, they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.56"></a>“Monastics, this is the path where all things come together as one, to purify sentient beings, to make an end of pain and sadness, to get past sorrow and lamentation, to reach the way, to witness Nibbāna; that is, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>What four? Here, a monastic meditates by observing an aspect of the body, keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate by observing an aspect of feelings, keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate by observing an aspect of the mind, keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate by observing an aspect of principles, keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>

<h2>1. Observing the body </h2><h3>1.1. Mindfulness of breathing </h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>And how, monastics, does a monastic meditate by observing an aspect of the body? Here, a monastic has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty building. They sit down in the meditation posture, with their body erect, and focus their mindfulness right there. Mindful, they breath in; mindful, they breath out. </p>
<p>Breathing in deep they clearly know ‘I am breathing in deep’; breathing out deep they clearly know ‘I am breathing out deep’. </p>
<p>Breathing in shallow they clearly know ‘I am breathing in shallow’; breathing out shallow they clearly know ‘I am breathing out shallow’. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>They practice like this: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole breath’; they practice like this: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole breath’. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>They practice like this: ‘I will breathe in stilling the breath-energies’; they practice like this: ‘I will breathe out stilling the breath-energies’. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>It is like a skilled carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice: when making a deep cut they would clearly know ‘I am making a deep cut’, and when making a shallow cut they would clearly know ‘I am making a shallow cut’. </p>
<p>In the same way, when a monastic is breathing in deep they clearly know ‘I am breathing in deep’; breathing out deep they clearly know ‘I am breathing out deep’. </p>
<p>Breathing in shallow they clearly know ‘I am breathing in shallow’; breathing out shallow they clearly know ‘I am breathing out shallow’. </p>
<p>They practice like this: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole breath’; they practice like this: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole breath’. </p>
<p>They practice like this: ‘I will breathe in stilling the breath-energies’; they practice like this: ‘I will breathe out stilling the breath-energies’. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>In this way they meditate by observing an aspect of the body inside; they meditate by observing an aspect of the body outside; they meditate by observing an aspect of the body inside and outside. </p>
<p>They meditate by observing the reasons for the origination of the body; they meditate by observing the reasons for the dissolution of the body; they meditate by observing the reasons for the origination and dissolution of the body. </p>
<p>Or mindfulness is established that ‘There is a body’, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. This too is how a monastic meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>

<h3>1.2. The postures </h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.57"></a>Furthermore, monastics, when a monastic is walking they clearly know ‘I am walking’; when standing they clearly know ‘I am standing’; when sitting they clearly know ‘I am sitting’; and when lying down they clearly know ‘I am lying down’. Whatever posture their body is in, they clearly know it. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>In this way they meditate by observing an aspect of the body inside; they meditate by observing an aspect of the body outside; they meditate by observing an aspect of the body inside and outside. </p>
<p>They meditate by observing the reasons for the origination of the body; they meditate by observing the reasons for the dissolution of the body; they meditate by observing the reasons for the origination and dissolution of the body. </p>
<p>Or mindfulness is established that ‘There is a body’, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. This too is how a monastic meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>

<h3>1.3. Situational awareness </h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a>Furthermore, when a monastic goes out and returns they act with awareness; when looking to the front and to the side they act with awareness; when bending and extending their limbs they act with awareness; when wearing the robes, and carrying the bowl and outer robe they act with awareness; when eating drinking, chewing, and tasting they act with awareness; when defecating and urinating they act with awareness; when walking, standing, sitting, lying down, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent they act with awareness. </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a>In this way they meditate by observing an aspect of the body inside … This too is how a monastic meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>

<h3>1.4. Paying attention to the repulsive </h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>Furthermore, a monastic examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet, down from the hairs of the head, and surrounded by skin, as full of various kinds of impurities: ‘In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, snot, synovial fluid, and urine.’ </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>It is as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as hill rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, millet, and white rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents: ‘This is hill rice, this is wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, this is millet, and this is white rice.’ </p>
<p>In the same way, a monastic examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet, down from the hairs of the head, and surrounded by skin, as full of various kinds of impurities: ‘In this body there is head-hair, body-hair … urine.’ </p>

<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>Furthermore, a monastic examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’ </p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.58"></a>It is as if a skilled butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions. </p>
<p>In the same way a monastic examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’ </p>

<h3>1.6. The charnel ground contemplations </h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a>Furthermore, a monastic, just as if they were to see a corpse thrown in the charnel ground—dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering—they’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond this.’ In this way they meditate by observing an aspect of the body inside … This too is how a monastic meditates by observing an aspect of the body. <span class="brnum">(1)</span> </p>
