<p><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a>At one time the Gracious One was living near Rājagaha on the Vultures’ Peak Mountain.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a>Now at that time the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, had a desire to attack the Vajjians. He said this: “I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful, I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians”.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a>Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a>“Go, brahmin, and approach the Gracious One, and after approaching worship the Gracious One’s feet in my name, and ask whether he is free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably, <span class="add">and say</span>: ‘The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, reverend Sir, worships with his head at the Gracious One’s feet, and asks whether you are free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc5"></a>And say this: ‘The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, reverend Sir, desires to attack the Vajjians. He says this: “I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful, I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians.” And just what the Gracious One says to you, after learning it well, you must inform me, for the Realised Ones do not speak falsely.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc6"></a>“Very well, dear Sir,” and the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, after replying to the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, and having <span class="add">many</span> great and august vehicles prepared, and mounting <span class="add">those</span> great and august vehicles, departed with those great and august vehicles from Rājagaha, and after approaching by vehicle to the Vultures’ Peak Mountain as far as the ground for vehicles <span class="add">would allow</span>, and descending from the vehicles, he approached the Gracious One by foot, and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side, the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc7"></a>“The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, dear Gotama, worships with his head at dear Gotama’s feet, and asks whether you are free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc8"></a>The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, dear Gotama, desires to attack the Vajjians.

<h3 class="add"><a id="2" href="#toc">2: Seven Things which Prevent Decline in the Vajjians</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc9"></a>Now at that time venerable Ānanda was stood behind the Gracious One fanning the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc10"></a>1) “Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians assemble regularly and assemble frequently?’” “I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians assemble regularly and assemble frequently.’” “For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will assemble regularly and assemble frequently surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc11"></a>2) Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians assemble unanimously, rise unanimously, and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously?’” “I have heard this, reverend Sir, that the Vajjians assemble unanimously, rise unanimously, and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously.” “For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will assemble unanimously, rise unanimously, and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc13"></a>4) Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians honour the elders of the Vajjians, respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to?’” “I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians honour the elders of the Vajjians, respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to.’” “For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will honour the elders of the Vajjians, respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc14"></a>5) Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians do not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell <span class="add">with them</span> against their will?’” “I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians do not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell <span class="add">with them</span> against their will.’” “For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell <span class="add">with them</span> against their will, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc15"></a>6) Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians, both within and without <span class="add">the city</span>, respect, revere, and worship <span class="add">them</span>, and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected?’” “I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians, both within and without <span class="add">the city</span>, respect, revere, and worship <span class="add">them</span>, and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected.” “For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians, both within and without <span class="add">the city</span>, respect, revere, and worship <span class="add">them</span>, and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc16"></a>7) Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians have made good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones, so that Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm, and having entered the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm?” “I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians have made good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones, and that the Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm, and having entered the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm.” “For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will make good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones, and that the Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm, and having entered, the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc17"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, <span class="add">saying</span>: “At one time, brahmin, I was living near Vesālī near to the Sārandada Shrine and there I taught the Vajjians these seven things which prevent decline. For as long, brahmin, as the Vajjians maintain these seven things which prevent decline, and the Vajjians agree with these seven things which prevent decline, surely growth, brahmin, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc18"></a>After this was said, the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra addressed the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “If the Vajjians, dear Gotama, were endowed with even one or the other of these seven things which prevent decline, surely growth is to be expected not decline, what to say about having seven things which prevent decline? The Vajjians cannot be overcome, dear Gotama, by the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, by war, but only through diplomacy, or through the breaking of an alliance. And now, dear Gotama, we shall go, as we have many duties, and there is much which ought to be done.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc19"></a>“Now is the time, brahmin, for whatever you are thinking.” Then the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Gracious One, rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="1-7" href="#toc">3: Seven Things which Prevent Decline in the Community (1–7)</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc20"></a>Then the Gracious One, not long after the Magadhan chief minister, the brahmin Vassakāra, had gone, addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Go, Ānanda, and whatever monks there are living in dependence on Rājagaha, assemble them in the Attendance Hall.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc21"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and assembling whatever monks there were living in dependence on Rājagaha in the Attendance Hall, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood on one side.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc23"></a>Then the Gracious One after rising from his seat approached the Attendance Hall, and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat. While sitting the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc91"></a>“You have spoken this great and imposing speech, Sāriputta, a definite, <span class="add">well-</span>grasped, lion’s roar that was roared, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Gracious One in this way: that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found another ascetic or brahmin who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Gracious One.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc92"></a>But have you, Sāriputta, understood those who, in past times, were Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas, and known with your mind the minds of those Gracious Ones? <span class="add">Or that</span> those Gracious Ones had such and such virtues, those Gracious Ones had such and such qualities, those Gracious Ones had such and such wisdom, those Gracious Ones had such and such lifestyles, those Gracious Ones had such and such liberations?”</p>
<p>“No, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc93"></a>“But have you, Sāriputta, understood those who, in the future times, will be Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas, and known with your mind the minds of those Gracious Ones? <span class="add">Or that</span> those Gracious Ones will have such and such virtues, those Gracious Ones will have such and such qualities, those Gracious Ones will have such and such wisdom, those Gracious Ones will have such and such lifestyles, those Gracious Ones will have such and such liberations?”</p>
<p>“No, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc94"></a>“But have you understood I, who am, at present, a Worthy and Perfect Sambuddha, and known with your mind <span class="add">my</span> mind? <span class="add">Or that</span> the Gracious One has such and such virtues, the Gracious One has such and such qualities, the Gracious One has such and such wisdom, the Gracious One has such and such a lifestyle, the Gracious One has such and such a liberation?”</p>
<p>“No, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc95"></a>“Here then, Sāriputta, in regard to those past, future, and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas you have no full and exact knowledge with <span class="add">your own</span> mind. Then how is it, Sāriputta, at present that you have spoken <span class="add">such</span> a great and imposing speech, a definite, <span class="add">well-</span>grasped, lion’s roar that was roared, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Gracious One in this way: that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found another ascetic or brahmin who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Gracious One’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc96"></a>“I do not, reverend Sir, in regard to those past, future, and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas have full and exact knowledge with <span class="add">my own</span> mind. However, I understand <span class="add">what I said</span> is in conformity with the Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc97"></a>It is like a King’s city, reverend Sir, near the border areas, having strong foundations, strong walls and gateways, and a single door, and there is a watchman, wise, accomplished, and intelligent, warding off those unknown, and letting through those well-known. While going around the road on inspection through the whole of that city he may not see <span class="add">such</span> fissures in the wall or openings in the wall that even a cat could go out through, it may be so, <span class="add">but he knows</span>: ‘Whatever grosser beings enter or depart from this city all of them surely enter or depart through this door.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc98"></a>Similarly, reverend Sir, I understand it is in conformity with the Teaching, that whoever, reverend Sir, in the past times, are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, all those Gracious Ones, after giving up the five hindrances, have penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble, have established their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness, and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening, have awakened to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc99"></a>That whoever, reverend Sir, in the future times, are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas all those Gracious Ones, after giving up the five hindrances, and penetrating with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble, and establishing their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness, and developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening, will awaken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc100"></a>And the Gracious One, reverend Sir, in the present time, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha, <span class="add">also</span> after giving up the five hindrances, has penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble, has established his mind in the four ways of attending to mindfulness, and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening, has awoken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc101"></a>There also the Gracious One, while living near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s Mango Wood, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc102"></a>“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of <span class="add">craving for</span> continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="11" href="#toc">11: The Advantages of Virtue</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc103"></a>Then the Gracious One, after living near Nāḷandā for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come Ānanda let us approach Pāṭaligāma.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc104"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Pāṭaligāma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc105"></a>The laymen of Pāṭaligāma heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, had reached Pāṭaligāma.” Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sitting on one side, the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Gracious One: “May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to <span class="add">stay in</span> our rest house.” The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc106"></a>Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, having understood the Gracious One’s consent, after rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, approached their rest house, and after approaching, and spreading <span class="add">the mats</span> so that the rest house was spread all over, and preparing the seats, setting up the water-pot, and lighting the oil-lamp, they approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they stood on one side. While standing on one side, the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc107"></a>“The rest house is spread with mats all over, reverend Sir, the seats are prepared, the water-pot is set up, and the oil-lamp is lit, now is the time, reverend Sir, for whatever the Gracious One is thinking.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc108"></a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the evening time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached the rest house, and after approaching, washing his feet, and entering the rest house, he sat down near to the middle pillar, facing the East, and the Community of monks, after washing their feet, and entering the rest house, sat down <span class="add">behind the Gracious One</span> near the West wall, facing the East, having the Gracious One in front <span class="add">of them</span>. Also the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, after washing their feet, and entering the rest house, sat down <span class="add">in front of the Gracious One</span> near the East wall, facing the West, having the Gracious One in front <span class="add">of them</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc109"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, <span class="add">saying</span>: “There are these five dangers, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p>What are the five?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc110"></a>1) Here, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, because of being heedless undergoes a great loss of riches. This is the first danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc111"></a>2) Furthermore, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue, a bad report goes round. This is the second danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc112"></a>3) Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, whatever assembly he approaches, whether an assembly of Nobles, or an assembly of brahmins, or an assembly of householders, or an assembly of ascetics, he approaches without confidence, with confusion. This is the third danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc113"></a>4) Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, dies bewildered. This is the fourth danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc114"></a>5) Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, at the break-up of the body, after death, arises in the lower world, in an unfortunate destiny, in the fall, in the nether regions. This is the fifth danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc115"></a>These are the five dangers, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc116"></a>There are these five advantages, householders, for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.</p>
<p>What are the five?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc117"></a>1) Here, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue, because of being heedful obtains a great mass of riches. This is the first advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc118"></a>2) Furthermore, householders, of one who is virtuous, of one accomplished in virtue, a good report goes round. This is the second advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc119"></a>3) Furthermore, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue, whatever assembly he approaches, whether an assembly of Nobles, or an assembly of brahmins, or an assembly of householders, or an assembly of ascetics, approaches with confidence, without confusion. This is the third advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc120"></a>4) Furthermore, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue, dies without bewilderment. This is the fourth advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc121"></a>5) Furthermore, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue, at the break-up of the body, after death, arises in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world. This is the fifth advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc122"></a>These are the five advantages, householders, for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc123"></a>Then the Gracious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the laymen of Pāṭaligāma for most of the night with a talk about the Teaching, dismissed them, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The night has passed, householders, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc124"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said those laymen of Pāṭaligāma, and after replying to the Gracious One, rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc125"></a>Then the Gracious One, not long after the laymen of Pāṭaligāma had gone, entered an empty place.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="12" href="#toc">12: Building up Pāṭaligāma</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc126"></a>Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra were building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians. Then at that time a great many Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc127"></a>In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds, there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers’ minds inclined to building up residences.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc128"></a>In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds, there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers’ minds inclined to building up residences.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc129"></a>In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds, there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers’ minds inclined to building up residences.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc130"></a>The Gracious One saw with his Divine-eye, which is purified, and surpasses that of <span class="add">normal</span> men, that those Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc131"></a>Then towards the time of dawn, having risen from his seat, the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Now who, Ānanda, is building a city at Pāṭaligāma?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc132"></a>“The Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, reverend Sir, are building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc133"></a>“It is just as though, Ānanda, <span class="add">they are building</span> after consulting with the Tāvatiṃsa Divinities, so, Ānanda, are the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc134"></a>Here, Ānanda, I saw with my Divine-eye, which is purified, and surpasses that of <span class="add">normal</span> men, that a great many Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc135"></a>In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds, there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers’ minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc137"></a>In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds, there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers’ minds inclined to building up residences.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc138"></a>For as long, Ānanda, as there is an Ariyan sphere <span class="add">of influence</span>, for as long as there is trade, this basket-opening Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city. For Pāṭaliputta, Ānanda, there will be three dangers: from fire and from water and from the breaking of an alliance.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc139"></a>Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, they exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, they stood on one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc140"></a>While standing on one side the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra said this to the Gracious One: “May dear Gotama consent to us <span class="add">offering him</span> a meal today, together with the Community of monks.” The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc141"></a>Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra having understood the Gracious One’s consent, approached their own dwelling, and after approaching, in their own dwellings, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready, had the time announced to the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It is time, dear Gotama, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc142"></a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached the dwelling of the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc143"></a>Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with their own hands served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with excellent foodstuffs. Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, when the Gracious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a low seat, sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc144"></a>While sitting on one side the Gracious One rejoiced the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc145"></a>“In that place where he makes his dwelling, having entertained<br>
The wise and virtuous here, the restrained, who live the spiritual life,<br>
He should dedicate a gift <span class="add">of merit</span> to those Divinities who were in that place.<br>
Honoured, they pay honour, revered, they revere him.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc146"></a>Thereafter they have compassion on him, as a mother on her own son,<br>
A man whom the Divinities has compassion on always sees what is auspicious.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc147"></a>Then the Gracious One after rejoicing the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with these verses, after rising from his seat, went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc148"></a>Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra were following close behind the Gracious One, <span class="add">thinking</span>: “That gate by which the ascetic Gotama leaves will get the name the Gotama Gate, and that ford by which he crosses the river Ganges will get the name the Gotama Ford.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc149"></a>Then that gate by which the Gracious One left got the name the Gotama Gate. Then the Gracious One approached the river Ganges. Now at that time the river Ganges was full to the brim, and could be drunk from by crows <span class="add">perched on the bank</span>. Some of the people were seeking boats, some were seeking floats, and some were binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc150"></a>Then the Gracious One, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, so did he vanish from the near bank of the river Ganges, and reappeared on the far bank, together with the Community of monks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc151"></a>The Gracious One saw those people, some seeking boats, some seeking floats, and some binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc152"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc153"></a>“Those who cross over a sea or a river, <br><span class="add">Do so</span> after making a bridge, and leaving the marshes behind. <br><span class="add">While</span> people are still binding together a raft,<br>
Intelligent people have crossed over.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc154"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come Ānanda let us approach Koṭigāma.” “Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Koṭigāma. There the Gracious One lived near Koṭigāma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc155"></a>There the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of Four Noble Truths both you and I have been wandering and running along <span class="add">in Saṃsāra</span> for a long time.</p>
<p>Which four?</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc161"></a>The Gracious One said this, and after saying this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, said something more:</p>

<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc163"></a>There also the Gracious One, while living in Koṭigāma, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc166"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at the Nādikas. There the Gracious One lived near <span class="add">one of</span> the Nādikas in the Brick House.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc167"></a>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc195"></a>But it is not such a wonder, Ānanda, that those who have become human should die, but if <span class="add">every time</span> there is a death in this place, after approaching the Realised One, you were to ask about it, Ānanda, that would be troublesome to the Realised One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc196"></a>Therefore, Ānanda, I will teach <span class="add">this</span> presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of <span class="add">the True Nature of</span> Things, endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself: ‘Exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> Hell, exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> an animal’s womb, exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unfortunate destiny in the lower realms, I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling <span class="add">into the lower realms</span>, and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc197"></a>And what, Ānanda, is <span class="add">this</span> presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of <span class="add">the True Nature of</span> Things, endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself: ‘Exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> Hell, exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> an animal’s womb, exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unfortunate destiny in the lower realms, I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling <span class="add">into the lower realms</span>, and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening’?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc198"></a>Here, Ānanda, a Noble Disciple is endowed with perfect confidence in the Buddha <span class="add">thinking</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc199"></a>‘Such is he, the Gracious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha, the one endowed with understanding and good conduct, the Fortunate One, the One who understands the worlds, the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming, the Teacher of Divinities and men, the Buddha, the Gracious One.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc200"></a>He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Teaching <span class="add">thinking</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc201"></a>‘The Teaching has been well-proclaimed by the Gracious One, it is visible, not subject to time, inviting inspection, onward leading, and can be understood by the wise for themselves.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc202"></a>He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Community <span class="add">thinking</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc203"></a>‘The Gracious One’s Community of disciples are good in their practice, the Gracious One’s Community of disciples are straight in their practice, the Gracious One’s Community of disciples are systematic in their practice, the Gracious One’s Community of disciples are correct in their practice, that is to say, the four pairs of persons, the eight individual persons, this is the Gracious One’s Community of disciples, they are worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts, and of reverential salutation, they are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc204"></a>He is endowed with the lovely Ariyan virtue, unbroken, faultless, unspotted, unblemished, productive of freedom, praised by the wise, not adhered to, leading to concentration.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc205"></a>This is the presentation of the Teaching, Ānanda, called the Mirror of <span class="add">the True Nature of</span> Things endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself: ‘Exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> Hell, exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> an animal’s womb, exhausted is <span class="add">birth in</span> the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unfortunate destiny in the lower realms, I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling <span class="add">into the lower realms</span>, and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.’”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc206"></a>There also the Gracious One, while living near Nādika in the Brick House, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc207"></a>“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of <span class="add">craving for</span> continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="15" href="#toc">15: The Courtesan Ambapālī</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc208"></a>Then the Gracious One, after living near Nādika for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come Ānanda let us approach Vesālī.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc209"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Vesālī. There the Gracious One lived near Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Wood. There the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc210"></a>“Mindfully and with full awareness, monks, a monk should live, this is our advice to you. And how, monks, is a monk mindful?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc211"></a>Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> the mind in the mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> things in <span class="add">various</span> things, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc212"></a>Thus, monks, a monk is mindful. And how, monks, does a monk have full awareness?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc213"></a>Here, monks, a monk in going forwards, in going back, is one who practises with full awareness, in looking ahead, or in looking around, he is one who practises with full awareness, in bending or in stretching, he is one who practises with full awareness, in bearing his double-robe, bowl, and <span class="add">other</span> robes, he is one who practises with full awareness, in eating, in drinking, in chewing, in tasting, he is one who practises with full awareness, in passing stool and urine, he is one who practises with full awareness, in going, in standing, in sitting, in sleeping, in waking, in talking, and in maintaining silence, he is one who practises with full awareness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc214"></a>Thus, monks, a monk has full awareness. Mindfully and with full awareness, monks, a monk should live, this is our advice to you.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc215"></a>The courtesan Ambapālī heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has reached Vesālī and is living near Vesālī in my Mango Wood.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc216"></a>Then the courtesan Ambapālī, after having <span class="add">many</span> great and august vehicles prepared, and mounting <span class="add">those</span> great and august vehicles, departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī, and after approaching by vehicle to her pleasure garden as far as the ground for vehicles <span class="add">would allow</span>, and descending from the vehicles, she approached the Gracious One by foot, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, she sat down on one side. While the courtesan Ambapālī was sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered her with a talk about the Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc217"></a>Then the courtesan Ambapālī, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, said to the Gracious One: “May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to me <span class="add">offering him</span> a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc218"></a>The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence. Then the courtesan Ambapālī, having understood the Gracious One’s consent, after rising from her seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc219"></a>The Licchavīs from Vesālī heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, had reached Vesālī and is living near Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Wood.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc220"></a>Then those Licchavīs, after having <span class="add">many</span> great and august vehicles prepared, and mounting <span class="add">those</span> great and august vehicles, departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī. There some of the Licchavīs were blue, having a blue appearance, with blue clothes and blue decorations; some of the Licchavīs were yellow, having a yellow appearance, with yellow clothes and yellow decorations; some of the Licchavīs were red, having a red appearance, with red clothes and red decorations; some of the Licchavīs were white, having a white appearance, with white clothes and white decorations.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc221"></a>Then the courtesan Ambapālī rolled alongside the Licchavī youths axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke. Then those Licchavīs said this to the courtesan Ambapālī: “Why do you, Ambapālī, roll alongside the Licchavī youths axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc222"></a>“Because I have invited the Gracious One, noble sirs, for a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc223"></a>“Give <span class="add">us</span> this meal, Ambapālī, for a hundred thousand <span class="add"><i>kahapanas</i></span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc224"></a>“If, noble sirs, you would give Vesālī and its revenues still I would not give this meal <span class="add">to you</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc225"></a>Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers, <span class="add">thinking</span>: “We have surely been defeated by a woman, we have surely been defeated by a woman.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc226"></a>Then the Licchavīs entered Ambapālī’s Wood. The Gracious One saw those Licchavīs coming from afar, and having seen <span class="add">them</span>, he addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Let those monks who have not seen the Tāvatiṃsa Divinities, monks, look at the Licchavī troupe, monks, look upon the Licchavī troupe, monks, contemplate the Licchavī troupe, monks, who are like the Tāvatiṃsa <span class="add">Divinities</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc227"></a>Then after the Licchavīs had gone as far as the ground for vehicles <span class="add">would allow</span>, and had descended from the vehicles, they approached the Gracious One by foot, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc228"></a>While the Licchavīs were sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching. Then the Licchavīs, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, said to the Gracious One: “Please consent to us <span class="add">offering</span> a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc229"></a>“I have <span class="add">already</span> consented to the courtesan Ambapālī’s meal on the morrow.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc230"></a>Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers, <span class="add">thinking</span>: “We have surely been defeated by a woman, we have surely been defeated by a woman.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc231"></a>Then the Licchavīs, after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Gracious One, rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc232"></a>Then the courtesan Ambapālī after the night had passed, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready in her own pleasure park, had the time announced to the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc233"></a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached the courtesan Ambapālī’s residence, and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat. Then the courtesan Ambapālī with her own hand served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with excellent foodstuffs.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc234"></a>Then the courtesan Ambapālī, when the Gracious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a certain low seat, sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the courtesan Ambapālī said this to the Gracious One: “I donate this pleasure park, reverend Sir, to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc235"></a>The Gracious One accepted the pleasure park. Then the Gracious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the courtesan Ambapālī with a talk about the Teaching, having risen from the seat, went away.</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc236"></a>There also the Gracious One, while living in Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Wood, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc237"></a>“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of <span class="add">craving for</span> continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="16" href="#toc">16: The Gracious One’s Sickness</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc238"></a>Then the Gracious One, after living near Ambapālī’s Wood for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come Ānanda let us approach the little village of Beluva.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc239"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at the little village of Beluva. There the Gracious One lived near the little village of Beluva.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc240"></a>There the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Go, monks, and undertake the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī <span class="add">living</span> like friends, like companions, like comrades, and I will spend the Rains Retreat right here at the little village of Beluva.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc241"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” and those monks, after replying to the Gracious One, undertook the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī <span class="add">living</span> like friends, like companions, like comrades. But the Gracious One spent the Rains Retreat right there at the little village of Beluva.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc242"></a>Then while dwelling for the Rains Retreat, a heavy affliction arose for the Gracious One, and continued with strong and death-like feelings. There the Gracious One dwelt mindfully, with full awareness, and without being troubled. Then this occurred to the Gracious One: “It is not suitable that I, without having addressed my attendants, without having given notice to the Community of monks, should attain Final Emancipation. Having energetically dismissed this affliction, I could live on after determining the lifespan.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc243"></a>Then the Gracious One having energetically dismissed that affliction lived on after determining the lifespan. Then the Gracious One’s affliction abated. Then, the Gracious One, having risen from that sickness, not long after rising, departed from the Sick Room and sat down on the prepared seat in front of that Room.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc244"></a>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc245"></a>“I have seen, reverend Sir, the Gracious One comfortable, I have seen, reverend Sir, the Gracious One bearing up <span class="add">while sick</span>, and my body, reverend Sir, became faint as it were, and although I could not see <span class="add">straight</span>, and things were not clear, it appeared to me, reverend Sir, that the Gracious One was sick, <span class="add">but</span> it was some small comfort that the Gracious One would not attain Final Emancipation until the Gracious One had spoken regarding the Community of monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc246"></a>“But what, Ānanda, does the Community of monks expect of me? The Teaching has been taught by me, Ānanda, without having made <span class="add">a distinction between</span> esoteric and exoteric, for the Realised One there is nothing, Ānanda, of a <span class="add">closed</span> teacher’s fist in regard to the Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc247"></a>To whoever, Ānanda, this <span class="add">thought</span> occurs: ‘I will lead the Community of monks’ or ‘I am the instructer of the Community of monks’ let him speak, Ānanda, regarding the Community of monks. But to the Realised One, Ānanda, this <span class="add">thought</span> does not occur: ‘I will lead the Community of monks’ or ‘I am the instructor of the Community of monks’. Then why, Ānanda, should the Realised One speak regarding the Community of monks?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc248"></a>I, Ānanda, at present, am old, elderly, of great age, far gone, advanced in years, I am eighty years old. It is like, Ānanda, an old cart, which <span class="add">only</span> keeps going when shored up with bamboo, just so, Ānanda, I think the Realised One’s body <span class="add">only</span> keeps going when shored up with bamboo.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc249"></a>When the Realised One doesn’t pay attention, Ānanda, to any of the signs, when all feelings have ceased, he lives having established the signless mind-concentration, and at that time, Ānanda, the Realised One’s body is most comfortable.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc250"></a>Therefore, Ānanda, live with yourself as an island, yourself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge. And how, Ānanda, does a monk live with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc251"></a>Here, Ānanda, a monk dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> the mind in the mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class="add">the nature of</span> things in <span class="add">various</span> things, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc252"></a>Thus, Ānanda, a monk lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge. For whoever, Ānanda, whether at present or after my passing, lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge, those monks of mine, Ānanda, will go from darkness to the highest—whoever likes the training.”</p>

<h3 class="add"><a id="17" href="#toc">17: Ānanda’s Failure</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc253"></a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. After walking for alms in Vesālī, and returning from the alms-round after the meal, he addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Take up the sitting mat, Ānanda, we will approach the Cāpāla shrine to dwell for the day.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc254"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and taking the sitting mat, he followed along close behind the Gracious One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc255"></a>Then the Gracious One approached the Cāpāla shrine, and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat, and also venerable Ānanda, after worshipping the Gracious One, sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: “Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Many Sons’ shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine, delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.</p>

The Realised One has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power. If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc257"></a>But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Gracious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men,” like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc258"></a>For a second time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Many Sons’ shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine, delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.</p>

The Realised One has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power. If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc260"></a>But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Gracious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men,” like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc261"></a>For a third time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Many Sons’ shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine, delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.</p>

If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc263"></a>But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Gracious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men,” like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc267"></a>“May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc268"></a>‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my monks are not <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc269"></a>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s monks are <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc270"></a>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc271"></a>‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my nuns are not <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc272"></a>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s nuns are <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc273"></a>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc274"></a>‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my laymen are not <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc275"></a>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s laymen are <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc276"></a>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc277"></a>‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my laywomen are not <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc278"></a>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s laywomen are <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc279"></a>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc280"></a>‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous, well spread-out, possessed by many, become great, until it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc281"></a>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s spiritual life is successful and prosperous, well spread-out, possessed by many, become great, it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men. May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc282"></a>When that was said the Gracious One said this to the Wicked Māra: “You should have little concern, Wicked One, in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated, after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc283"></a>Then at the Cāpāla shrine the Gracious One, mindfully, with full awareness, relinquished the life-process. With the relinquishment of the life-process by the Gracious One there was a great earthquake, and a fearful, horrifying crash of the Divinities’ <span class="add">thunder</span> drum.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc284"></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc285"></a>“Measurable and immeasurable continuity,<br>
And the continuation-process the Sage relinquished.<br>
Content in himself, and concentrated,<br>
He broke continuity of self like a coat of mail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="add"><a id="19" href="#toc">19: Eight Reasons for Earthquakes</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc286"></a>Then it occured to venerable Ānanda: “Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, this great earthquake, this very great earthquake, and <span class="add">this</span> awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities’ <span class="add">thunder</span> drum. What was the reason, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc287"></a>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down at one side. Sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Surely it is wonderful, reverend Sir, surely it is marvellous, reverend Sir, this great earthquake, this very great earthquake, and <span class="add">this</span> awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities’ <span class="add">thunder</span> drum. What was the reason, reverend Sir, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc288"></a>“There are these eight reasons, eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p>Which eight?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc289"></a>1) This great Earth, Ānanda, stands in the water, the water stands in the atmosphere, the atmosphere stands in space. There comes a time, Ānanda, when great winds blow, with the great winds blowing, the waters move, the waters having moved, the Earth moves. This is the first reason, the first cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc290"></a>2) Furthermore, Ānanda, when an ascetic or a brahmin or a Divinity, one of great power, one of great majesty, has, through spiritual power, attained <span class="add">complete</span> mastery of the mind, and has then developed even a trifling perception of the Earth, or an unlimited perception of water, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the second reason, the second cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc291"></a>3) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be falls away from the Tusita hosts, and mindfully, with full awareness, enters his mother’s womb, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the third reason, the third cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc292"></a>4) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be mindfully, with full awareness, exits his mother’s womb, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the fourth reason, the fourth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc293"></a>5) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the fifth reason, the fifth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc294"></a>6) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One sets the unsurpassed wheel of the Teaching rolling, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the sixth reason, the sixth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc295"></a>7) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One mindfully, with full awareness gives up the life-process, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the seventh reason, the seventh cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc296"></a>8) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the eighth reason, the eighth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. These are the eight reasons, the eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="20" href="#toc">20: The Eight Assemblies</a></h3>
<p>There are, Ānanda, eight assemblies.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc316"></a>2) Not perceiving forms internally, he sees forms externally. This is the second liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc317"></a>3) One is intent on endless beauty. This is the third liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc318"></a>4) Having completely transcended perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of <span class="add">sensory</span> impact, not attending to perceptions of variety, <span class="add">understanding</span>: ‘This is endless space’, he abides in the sphere of endless space. This is the fourth liberation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc319"></a>5) Having completely transcended the sphere of endless space, <span class="add">understanding</span>: ‘This is endless consciousness’, he abides in the sphere of endless consciousness. This is the fifth liberation.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc322"></a>8) Having completely transcended the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth liberation.</p>
<p>These, Ānanda, are the eight liberations.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="23" href="#toc">23: Ānanda’s Fault</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc323"></a>At one time Ānanda I was living at Uruvelā, on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the root of the Goatherd’s Banyan tree, in the first <span class="add">period</span> after attaining Awakening. Then, Ānanda, the Wicked Māra approached me, and after approaching he stood on one side. While standing to one side, Ānanda, the Wicked Māra said this to me:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc324"></a>“May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc325"></a>After this was said, Ānanda, I said this to the Wicked Māra: “I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my monks are not <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc326"></a>I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my nuns are not <span class="add">true</span> disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc330"></a>Now today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine the Wicked Māra approached me, and after approaching he stood on one side. While standing on one side the Wicked Māra said this to me:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc331"></a>‘May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc343"></a>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One’s Final Emancipation. For the Gracious One has said these words:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc347"></a>When that was said, Ānanda, I said this to the Wicked Māra: ‘You should have little concern, Wicked One, in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated, after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.’ Now today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine the Realised One mindfully, with full awareness, gave up the life-process.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc348"></a>When this was said venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Let the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, let the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, having compassion on the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc349"></a>“Enough, Ānanda, do not beg the Realised One, now is the wrong time, Ānanda, for begging the Realised One.”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc355"></a>“Do you, Ānanda, have faith in the Realised One’s Awakening?”</p>
<p>“Yes, reverend Sir,”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc356"></a>“Then why do you, Ānanda, harrass the Realised One up and till the third time?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc357"></a>“Face to face with me, reverend Sir, face to face I have heard <span class="add">you say</span>: ‘Whoever has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power, could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc376"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One with venerable Ānanda approached the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood, and after approaching he addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc378"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One and assembling whatever monks were living in dependance on Vesālī in the Attendance Hall, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood at one side.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc379"></a>Then the Gracious One approached the Attendance Hall, and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat. While sitting the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc390"></a>There the Gracious One said this to the monks: “Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of four things both you and I have been wandering and running along <span class="add">in Saṃsāra</span> for a long time.</p>

<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc398"></a>There also the Gracious One, while living in Bhaṇḍagāma, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc399"></a>“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of <span class="add">craving for</span> continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”</p>

Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well, they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc406"></a>2) If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare <span class="add">well</span> with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is not the Gracious One’s word, it is not well learned by that monk,’ and, monks, you should abandon it.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc407"></a>3) Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: ‘In a certain dwelling place lives a Community with elders and leaders, I have heard this directly from that Community, directly I learned it: “This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.”’ Those monks’ speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc409"></a>5) Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: ‘In a certain dwelling place live many elders, very learned, who have learned the traditions, who are bearers of the Teaching, bearers of the Discipline, bearers of the Tabulation, I have heard this directly from those elders, directly I learned it: “This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.”’ Those monks’ speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc411"></a>7) Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: ‘In a certain dwelling place lives one elder, very learned, who has learned the traditions, a bearer of the Teaching, a bearer of the Discipline, a bearer of the Tabulation, I have heard this directly from that elder, directly I learned it: “This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.”’ That monk’s speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc414"></a>“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of <span class="add">craving for</span> continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="29" href="#toc">29: The Last Meal</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc415"></a>Then the Gracious One, after living near Bhoganagara for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come Ānanda let us approach Pāvā.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc416"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Pāvā. There the Gracious One lived near Pāvā in Cunda the Smith’s mango wood.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc417"></a>Cunda the Smith heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has arrived at Pāvā, and is dwelling near Pāvā, in my mango wood.” Then Cunda the Smith approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While Cunda the Smith was sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered him with a talk about the Teaching. Then Cunda the Smith, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, said this to the Gracious One: “May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to me <span class="add">offering him</span> a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc418"></a>The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence. Then Cunda the Smith, having understood the Gracious One’s consent, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc419"></a>Then after the night had passed, Cunda the Smith, in his own residence, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready, and an abundance of tender pork, had the time announced to the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc420"></a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached Cunda the Smith’s residence, and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down, the Gracious One addressed Cunda the Smith, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc421"></a>“Serve me with the tender pork you have prepared, Cunda, but serve the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs which have been prepared.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc422"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir”, said Cunda the Smith, and after replying to the Gracious One, he served the Gracious One with the tender pork that had been prepared, but served the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs which had been prepared. Then the Gracious One addressed Cunda the Smith, <span class="add">saying</span>:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc423"></a>“Throw that left over tender pork into a pit, Cunda, <span class="add">for</span> I do not see, Cunda, in the world with its Divinities, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men, one who, having eaten it, could completely digest it, except for a Realised One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc424"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir”, said Cunda the Smith, and after replying to the Gracious One, and throwing what was left over of that tender pork into a pit, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc425"></a>While sitting on one side Cunda the Smith having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, having risen from the seat, went away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc426"></a>Then for the Gracious One, after eating Cunda the Smith’s food, a painful affliction arose, bloody dysentery, and strong feelings occurred, such as end in death. There the Gracious One, mindfully, with full awareness, bore <span class="add">those pains</span> without being troubled. Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come, Ānanda, let us approach Kusinārā.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc427"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir”, venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc428"></a>“Having eaten Cunda the Smith’s food, so I have heard,<br>

A very strong sickness arose.<br>

<h3 class="add"><a id="30" href="#toc">30: Bringing Drinking Water</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc430"></a>Then the Gracious One, having gone down from the road, approached the root of a certain tree, and after approaching, he addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come now, Ānanda, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me, I am weary, Ānanda, and will sit down.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc431"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared the outer robe folded in four, and the Gracious One sat down on the prepared seat. While sitting the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc432"></a>After that was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by, and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed. The Kakutthā river is not far away, with transparent water, agreeable water, cool water, pure water, with beautiful banks, a delightful <span class="add">place</span>, there the Gracious One can drink drinking water, and can cool his limbs.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc433"></a>For a second time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc434"></a>For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by, and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc435"></a>For a third time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc436"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and taking the bowl, he approached the little river. Then that little river that was flowing, which had been churned by the wheels, and was stirred up and disturbed, as venerable Ānanda was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc437"></a>Then it occurred to venerable Ānanda: “Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, the Realised One’s great power and great majesty, in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed, as I was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc438"></a>After taking a bowl of drinking water he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, he said this to the Gracious One: “It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, the Realised One’s great power and great majesty, in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed, as I was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.

<h3 class="add"><a id="31" href="#toc">31: The Story concerning Pukkusa Mallaputta</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc439"></a>Now at that time Pukkasa Mallaputta, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma, was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā. Pukkasa Mallaputta saw the Gracious One sitting at the root of a certain tree. And having seen <span class="add">him</span> he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side Pukkasa Mallaputta said this to the Gracious One: “It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, that those who have gone forth, reverend Sir, live such a peaceful living.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc440"></a>Formerly, reverend Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma descended from the highway he was travelling along, and was dwelling for the day sat not far away at the root of a certain tree. Then, reverend Sir, about five hundred waggons passed by very close to Āḷāra Kālāma. Then, reverend Sir, a certain man who was traveling along behind those waggons approached Āḷāra Kālāma, and after approaching he said this to Āḷāra Kālāma:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc441"></a>‘Did you not see, reverend Sir, about five hundred waggons pass by?’</p>
<p>‘I did not see, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, did you not hear the sound?’</p>
<p>‘I did not hear the sound, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, were you sleeping?’</p>
<p>‘I was not sleeping, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, were you conscious?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc442"></a>‘So you, reverend Sir, though conscious and awake, when about five hundred waggons passed by very close neither saw <span class="add">them</span> nor heard a sound! Why, reverend Sir, even your double-robe is covered with dust!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc443"></a>Then this occurred to that man: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous, that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living. Because though conscious and awake, when about five hundred waggons passed by very close he did not see <span class="add">them</span> or hear a sound!’ And having gained great confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc444"></a>“Now what do you think, Pukkusa, which is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by: that someone though conscious and awake, when about five hundred waggons passed by very close should neither see <span class="add">them</span> nor hear a sound, or that someone, though conscious and awake, when the Divinities rain down, when the Divinities throw it down, and the lightning flashes, and the thunder crashes forth, should neither see <span class="add">it</span> nor hear a sound?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc445"></a>“Why, reverend Sir, what to make of five-hundred waggons, six-hundred waggons, seven-hundred waggons, eight-hundred waggons, nine-hundred waggons, one thousand waggons, or one-hundred thousand waggons? This is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by: that someone, though conscious and awake, when the Divinities rain down, when the Divinities throw it down, and the lightning flashes, and the thunder crashes forth, should neither see <span class="add">it</span> nor hear a sound.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc446"></a>“One day, Pukkusa, I was living near Ātumā at the Decorated House. Now at that time the Divinities rained down, the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, and not far away from the Decorated House two brothers who were farmers died, along with four oxen. Then, Pukkusa, a great crowd of people having departed from Ātumā, went to the place where the brothers who were farmers and the four oxen had died.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc447"></a>Then, Pukkusa, at that time, after leaving the Decorated House, I was walking in the open air near the gate to the Decorated House. Then, Pukkusa, a certain man from that crowd approached me, and after approaching and worshipping me, he stood on one side. While standing there, Pukkusa, I said to that man:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc448"></a>‘Why, friend, has that great crowd of people assembled?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc449"></a>‘Just now, reverend Sir, the Divinities rained down, the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, and two brothers who were farmers died, along with four oxen, and that great crowd of people assembled here. But where were you, reverend Sir?’</p>
<p>‘I was right here, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, did you see <span class="add">it</span>?’</p>
<p>‘I did not see, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, did you hear the sound?’</p>
<p>‘I did not hear the sound, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, were you sleeping?’</p>
<p>‘I was not sleeping, friend.’</p>
<p>‘But, reverend Sir, were you conscious?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc450"></a>‘So, reverend Sir, though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down, when the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, you neither saw <span class="add">it</span>, nor heard a sound!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, friend.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc451"></a>Then, Pukkusa, this occurred to that man: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous, that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living. Because though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down, when the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, he did not see <span class="add">it</span> or hear a sound!’ And after gaining great confidence in me, worshipping and circumamblating me, he left.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc452"></a>After this was said, Pukkusa Mallaputta said this to the Gracious One: “That faith, reverend Sir, I have in Āḷāra Kālāma, I clear away as with a great wind, I wash <span class="add">it</span> away as with a fast-flowing river:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc453"></a>Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent, reverend Sir! Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms, just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Gracious One in more than one way. I go to the Gracious One, reverend Sir, for refuge, and to the Teaching, and to the Community of monks. Please bear it in mind, Gracious One, that I am a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc454"></a>Then Pukkusa Mallaputta addressed a certain man, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come, my man, bring me a pair of polished gold-coloured <span class="add">robes</span>, ready to wear.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc455"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said that man, and after replying to Pukkusa Mallaputta, he brought a pair of polished gold-coloured <span class="add">robes</span>, ready to wear. Then Pukkusa Mallaputta offered that pair of polished gold-coloured <span class="add">robes</span>, ready to wear, to the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Please accept, reverend Sir, this pair of polished gold-coloured <span class="add">robes</span>, ready to wear out of compassion for me, Gracious One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc456"></a>“Then, Pukkusa, clothe me with one, and Ānanda with the other.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc457"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said Pukkusa Mallaputta, and after replying to the Gracious One clothed the Gracious One with one, and Ānanda with the other. Then the Gracious One instructed Pukkusa Mallaputta roused, enthused, and cheered <span class="add">him</span> with a talk about the Teaching. Then Pukkusa Mallaputta, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc458"></a>Then, venerable Ānanda, not long after Pukkusa Mallaputta had departed, offered that pair of polished gold-coloured <span class="add">robes</span>, ready to wear, to the Gracious One, and when placed on the Gracious One’s body they appeared to have lost their gleam.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc459"></a>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, how pure and clean is the Realised One’s skin-colour, reverend Sir! This pair of polished gold-coloured <span class="add">robes</span>, ready to wear, reverend Sir, when placed on the Gracious One’s body have lost their gleam!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc460"></a>“Just so, Ānanda, on two occasions, Ānanda, the Realised One’s skin-colour becomes exceedingly pure and clean.</p>
<p>On which two occasions?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc461"></a>That night, Ānanda, the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening, and that night the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining. On these two occasions the Realised One’s skin-colour is exceedingly pure and clean. Today, Ānanda, during the last watch of the night, near to Kusinārā, in the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, between a pair of Sal trees will be the Realised One’s Final Emancipation.</p>
<p>“Come Ānanda let us approach River Kakutthā.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc462"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">

<h3 class="add"><a id="32" href="#toc">32: Cunda’s Great Gain</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc464"></a>Then the Gracious One with a great Community of monks went to the river Kakutthā, and after going, and entering into the river Kakutthā, bathing, and drinking, and coming back out, he approached the mango wood, and after approaching, he addressed venerable Cundaka, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come now, Cundaka, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me, I am weary, Cundaka, and will lie down.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc465"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir”, said venerable Cundaka, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared the outer robe folded in four.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc484"></a>“Almost all of the Divinities, Ānanda, from the ten world-elements have assembled to see the Realised One, everywhere around Kusinārā and the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana for as far as twelve leagues there is no place, even so much as a tip of a pricking hair, unpervaded by powerful Divinities, and the Divinities, Ānanda, are complaining, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘We have come from afar to see the Realised One, only occasionally, infrequently, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world, and today during the last watch of the night will be the Realised One’s Final Emancipation, and this powerful monk is stood in front concealing the Realised One, and we are not able to see the Realised One at the last moment.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc485"></a>“But what beings and Divinities is the Gracious One thinking of?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc486"></a>“There are, Ānanda, Divinities in the sky, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down <span class="add">as though</span> cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they are crying: ‘Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc487"></a>There are, Ānanda, Divinities on the Earth, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down <span class="add">as though</span> cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they are crying: ‘Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc488"></a>But those Divinities who have cut off passion, mindfully, with full awareness, they endure, <span class="add">thinking</span>: ‘Impermanent are <span class="add">all</span> processes, how can it be otherwise?’”</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="35" href="#toc">35: The Four Places that Produce Enthusiasm</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc489"></a>“Formerly, reverend Sir, the monks, having dwelt for the Rains Retreat used to come to see the Realised One, and we would receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing <span class="add">the Realised One</span>. But after the Gracious One has passed way, reverend Sir, we will not receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing <span class="add">the Realised One</span>.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc490"></a>“There are these four places that can be seen, that produce enthusiasm, Ānanda, for a faithful man of good family.</p>
<p>Which four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc491"></a>1) <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘Here the Realised One was born’, Ānanda, <span class="add">that</span> is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc492"></a>2) <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening’, Ānanda, <span class="add">that</span> is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc493"></a>3) <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching’, Ānanda, <span class="add">that</span> is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc494"></a>4) <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘Here the Realised One was completely Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining’, Ānanda, <span class="add">that</span> is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc495"></a>These are the four places, Ānanda, that are to be seen that produce enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc496"></a>Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, <span class="add">thinking</span>: ‘Here the Realised One was born’, ‘Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening’, ‘Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching’, ‘Here the Realised One was Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining’, and whoever, Ānanda, will die while on pilgrimage to the Shrines with a confident mind they will all, at the break-up of the body, after death, re-arise in a fortunate destiny, in a heavenly world.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc497"></a>“How, reverend Sir, are we to act in regard to women?”</p>
<p>“<span class="add">As though they were</span> not seen, Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc498"></a>“<span class="add">But</span> when seeing them, reverend Sir, how are we to act?”</p>
<p>“Without conversing, Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc499"></a>“<span class="add">But</span> when conversing, reverend Sir, how are we to act?”</p>
<p>“You should attend to mindfulness, Ānanda.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc500"></a>“How should we act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Realised One’s body?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc501"></a>“Do not worry, Ānanda, about how you are to worshipfully <span class="add">dispose of</span> the Realised One’s body. Come, Ānanda, live striving for the highest good, being devoted to the highest good, being heedful of the highest good, ardent, and resolute. There are, Ānanda, wise Nobles, wise brahmins, wise householders who have faith in the Realised One. They will worshipfully <span class="add">dispose of</span> the Realised One’s body.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc502"></a>“How should we act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Realised One’s body?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc503"></a>“As you act in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body, so you should act in regard to the Realised One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc504"></a>“But how do they act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc505"></a>“They wrap the Universal Monarch’s body, Ānanda, with clean cloth, and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrap with carded cotton, and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrap with clean cloth, by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarch’s body with five-hundred pairs <span class="add">of cloth and cotton</span>, enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub, and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they burn the Universal Monarch’s body, and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc506"></a>So they act in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body, and as they act in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body so should they act in regard to a Realised One’s body, and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads. Whoever there prepares flowers, incense, or powder, or worships or establishes confidence in his mind, that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time.</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc507"></a>These four <span class="add">persons</span>, Ānanda, are worthy of a Shrine.</p>
<p class="p2">Which four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc508"></a>1) A Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine,</p>
<p>2) an Individual Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc509"></a>3) a Realised One’s disciple is worthy of a Shrine,</p>
<p>4) a Universal Monarch is worthy of a Shrine.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc510"></a>And for what reason or cause is a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine? <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘This is the Shrine of a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha’, Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world. This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc511"></a>And for what reason or cause is an Individual Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine? <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘This is the Shrine of a Gracious One, an Individual Sambuddha’, Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc512"></a>And for what reason or cause is a Realised One’s disciple worthy of a Shrine? <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘This is the Shrine of a disciple of a Gracious One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha’, Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world. This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why a Realised One’s disciple is worthy of a Shrine.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc513"></a>And for what reason or cause is a Universal Monarch worthy of a Shrine? <span class="add">Thinking</span>: ‘This is the Shrine of Righteous Monarch, a Righteous King’, Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world.

<h3 class="add"><a id="36" href="#toc">36: Ānanda’s Marvellous Qualities</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc514"></a>Then venerable Ānanda, after entering the living place, and leaning against the door-lintel, stood there crying: “The Teacher will attain Final Emancipation while I am still a Trainee with much to do, he who has compassion for me!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc515"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Where, monks, is Ānanda?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc516"></a>“This venerable Ānanda, reverend Sir, after entering the living place, and leaning against the door-lintel, stands there crying: ‘The Teacher will attain Final Emancipation while I am still a Trainee with much to do, he who has compassion for me!’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc517"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed a certain monk, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Go, monk, and in my name address Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘The Teacher, friend Ānanda, is calling you.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc518"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir, and after replying to the Gracious One, he approached venerable Ānanda, and after approaching he said this to venerable Ānanda: “The Teacher, friend Ānanda, is calling you.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc519"></a>“Very well, friend,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to that monk, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc520"></a>“Enough, Ānanda, don’t grieve, don’t lament, were you not warned by me when I declared: ‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.’ How can it be otherwise, Ānanda, for that which is obtained, born, become, conditioned, subject to dissolution? It is not possible <span class="add">to say</span> this: ‘The Realised One’s body should not dissolve’.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc521"></a>For a long time, Ānanda, you dwelt near to the Realised One with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly bodily actions, with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly speech actions, with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly mental actions, you have done meritorious deeds, Ānanda, you should devote yourself to quickly striving to be one who is pollutant-free!”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc522"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Whoever were Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas in the past, monks, for those Gracious Ones also there were such superior attendants, just as Ānanda is for me; whoever will be Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas in the future, monks, for those Gracious Ones also there will be such superior attendants, just as Ānanda is for me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc523"></a>Ānanda is wise, monks, Ānanda is intelligent, monks, he knows: ‘This is the time for monks to approach and see the Realised One, this is the time for monks, this is the time for nuns, this is the time for laymen, this is the time for laywomen, this is the time for kings, for kings’ ministers, for outside teachers, for the disciples of outside teachers.’</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc524"></a>There are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.</p>
<p>Which four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc525"></a>1) If, monks, a group of monks approach to see Ānanda their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of monks are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc526"></a>2) If, monks, a group of nuns approach to see Ānanda their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of nuns are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc528"></a>4) If, monks, a group of laywomen approach to see Ānanda their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of laywomen are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc529"></a>These are the four wonderful and marvellous things about Ānanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc530"></a>There are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about the Universal Monarch.</p>
<p>Which four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc531"></a>1) If, monks, a group of Nobles approach to see the Universal Monarch their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of nobles are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc532"></a>2) If, monks, a group of brahmins approach to see the Universal Monarch their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of brahmins are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc534"></a>4) If, monks, a group of ascetics approach to see the Universal Monarch their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of ascetics are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc535"></a>In the same way there are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc536"></a>1) If, monks, a group of monks approach to see Ānanda their minds are uplifted through seeing <span class="add">him</span>, and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of monks are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc540"></a>There are the four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.”</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="37" href="#toc">37: Kusinārā’s History</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc541"></a>After this was said, venerable Ānanda addressed the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Reverend Sir, may the Gracious One not attain Final Emancipation in this small town, this barren town, this branch town. There are, reverend Sir, other great towns, such as: Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, Bārāṇasī—let the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation there. There are many wealthy Nobles there, wealthy brahmins, wealthy householders, who are devoted to the Realised One, and will worshipfully <span class="add">dispose of</span> the Realised One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc542"></a>“Do not say that, Ānanda, do not say that, Ānanda: ‘<span class="add">This</span> small town, this barren town, this branch town’. Formerly, Ānanda, there was a King by the name of Mahāsudassana, a Righteous Monarch, a Righteous King, who was victorious over the four quarters, one who had established a stable country, endowed with the seven jewels.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc543"></a>This Kusinārā, was then named Kusāvatī, and was King Mahāsudassana’s capital city. Stretching for twelve leagues from East to West, and seven leagues from North to South, the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda, successful, populous, full of people, with much food, just as, Ānanda, the capital city of the Divinities named Āḷakamandā is prosperous, successful, populous, full of people, with much food, so the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda, successful, populous, full of people, with much food.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc544"></a>The capital city Kusāvatī was never separated from the ten sounds, by day or by night, that is to say: the sound of elephants, the sound of horses, the sound of chariots, the sound of drums, the sound of tabours, the sound of lutes, the sound of songs, the sound of cymbals, the sound of hand bells, <span class="add">and with</span> ‘eat, drink, chew!’ as the tenth sound.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="38" href="#toc">38: The Mallas Worship the Gracious One</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc545"></a>“Go, Ānanda, and after entering into Kusinārā, announce to the Mallas: ‘Today, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, do not regret it afterwards <span class="add">thinking</span>: “In the area of our village, was the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One”’.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc546"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, dressing, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārā with a companion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc547"></a>Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall having some business or other. Then venerable Ānanda went to where the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall, and after approaching he said this to the Mallas: “Today, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, do not regret it afterwards <span class="add">thinking</span>: ‘In the area of our village, was the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc548"></a>After hearing this from venerable Ānanda, the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering. Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down <span class="add">as though</span> cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: “Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc549"></a>Then the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas, miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering, approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc550"></a>Then this occurred to venerable Ānanda: “If I make the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Gracious One one by one before the Gracious One has been worshipped by the Mallas of Kusinārā the night will end. Now what if I, having segregated the Mallas family by family, made them worship the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors worships the Gracious One’s feet with his head’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc551"></a>Then venerable Ānanda having segregated the Mallas family by family, made them worship the Gracious One, <span class="add">saying</span>: “A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors worships the Gracious One’s feet with his head.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc552"></a>Then venerable Ānanda, in this way, during the first watch of the night, made the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Gracious One.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="39" href="#toc">39: Subhadda, the Last Direct Disciple</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc553"></a>Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda had arrived at Kusinārā. The wanderer Subhadda heard: “Today, it seems, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc554"></a>Then this occurred to the wanderer Subhadda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: ‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc555"></a>Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda, and after approaching he said to venerable Ānanda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: ‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt’. It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc556"></a>After this was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc557"></a>For a second time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: ‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt’. It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc558"></a>For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc559"></a>For a third time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.

It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc560"></a>For a third time venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc561"></a>The Gracious One heard venerable Ānanda having this conversation with the wanderer Subhadda. Then the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: “Enough, Ānanda, do not obstruct Subhadda allow Subhadda to see the Realised One. Whatever Subhadda will ask of me all of it he will ask of me seeking for deep knowledge, and not to trouble me. Whatever question is put I will answer, and he will quickly understand it.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc562"></a>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Go, friend Subhadda, the Gracious One has given you permission.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc563"></a>Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc564"></a>While sitting on one side the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Gracious One: “Those ascetics and brahmins, dear Gotama, who have a community, a group, who teach a group, well-known, famous, religious founders, agreed upon as good for the people, such as: Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, have they all understood, according to their own avowal? Have they all not understood? Or, have some understood? Or, have some not understood?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc565"></a>“Enough, Subhadda, stop this: ‘Have they all understood, according to their own avowal? Have they all not understood? Or, have some understood? Or, have some not understood?’ I will teach the Teaching to you, Subhadda, listen to it, apply your mind well, and I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc566"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” the wanderer Subhadda replied to the Gracious One, and the Gracious One said this: “Wherever, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is not found in a Teaching and Discipline there a <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is not found, there a second <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is not found, there a third <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is not found, there a fourth <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is not found.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc567"></a>But wherever, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is found in a Teaching and Discipline there a <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found, there a second <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found, there a third <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found, there a fourth <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc568"></a>In this Teaching and Discipline, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is found, here a <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found, here a second <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found, here a third <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found, here a fourth <span class="add">true</span> ascetic is found.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc569"></a>Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics, Subhadda, <span class="add">but</span> if monks should live well, the world will not be void of Worthy Ones.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc571"></a>Existing in the realm of the right Teaching<br>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc573"></a>After this was said, the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Gracious One: “Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent, reverend Sir! Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness, so that one who has eyes can see forms, just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Gracious One in more than one way. I go to the Gracious One for refuge, reverend Sir, and to the Teaching, and to the Community of monks. May I receive the going-forth, reverend Sir, in the presence of the Gracious One, may I receive the full ordination.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc574"></a>“Those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline desire the going-forth, who desire full ordination, live on probation for four months, and at the end of four months, the minds of the monks being satisfied, they give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood. But I understand there is a distinction between persons in this case.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc575"></a>“If, reverend Sir, those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline, desire the going-forth, who desire full ordination, live on probation for four months, and at the end of four months, the minds of the monks being satisfied, they give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood, then I will live on probation for four years, and at the end of four years, the minds of the monks being satisfied, they can give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc576"></a>Then the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: “Then, Ānanda, give the going-forth to Subhadda.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc577"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc578"></a>Then the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda: “There are certainly gains for you, friend Ānanda, it is certainly a good gain for you, friend Ānanda, that here, face to face with the Teacher, you have been consecrated with an attendant’s consecration.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc579"></a>The wanderer Subhadda received the going forth in the presence of the Gracious One, received full ordination.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc580"></a>Then not long after ordination, venerable Subhadda, while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, after no long time <span class="add">attained</span> that good for which young gentlemen rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life, that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life, and dwelt having known, experienced, and attained it himself in this very life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc581"></a>Destroyed is <span class="add">re</span>birth, accomplished is the spiritual life, done is what ought to be done, there is no more of this mundane state—this he knew.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc582"></a>And venerable Subhadda became another of the Worthy Ones. He was the last direct disciple of the Gracious One.</p>

<h3 class="add"><a id="40" href="#toc">40: The Last Instructions of the Realised One</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc583"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It may be, Ānanda, that some of you may think in this way: ‘Past is the Teacher’s word, there is now no Teacher for us.’ But it should not be seen like that, Ānanda, whatever Teaching and Discipline has been taught by me or laid down, Ānanda, that is your Teacher after my passing away.</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc584"></a>At present, Ānanda, the monks address each other with the word ‘friend’, <span class="add">but</span> after my passing away they are not to address <span class="add">one another</span> thus.

<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc586"></a>The highest penalty, Ānanda, after my passing away, is to be handed out to the monk Channa.” “But what is the highest penalty, reverend Sir?” “The monk Channa, Ānanda, may say whatever he wishes but he is not to be spoken to or advised or instructed by the monks.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc587"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc588"></a>For a second time the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc590"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “It may be, monks, that out of respect for the Teacher you do not ask, then one friend, monks, can inform another friend <span class="add">about his doubts</span>.” After this was said those monks were silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc591"></a>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, I am confident, reverend Sir, that in this Community of monks there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc592"></a>“Out of confidence, Ānanda, you speak, but the Realised One, Ānanda, has knowledge that there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice. For amongst these five hundred monks, Ānanda, he who is the last monk, is a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling <span class="add">into the lower realms</span>, and has a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc593"></a>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Come now, monks, for I tell you <span class="add">all</span> conditioned things are subject to decay, strive on with heedfulness!” These were the last words of the Realised One.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="41" href="#toc">41: The Final Emancipation</a></h3>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc596"></a>“The Gracious One, reverend Ānanda, has not attained Final Emancipation, he has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc597"></a>Then the Gracious One, after emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling, attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and after emerging from the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception he attained the sphere of nothingness, and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness he attained the sphere of endless consciousness, and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of endless space, and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the fourth absorption, and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the third absorption, and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the second absorption, and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the first absorption, and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption, and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption, and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption, and after emerging from the fourth absorption, immediately the Gracious One attained Final Emancipation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc598"></a>When the Gracious One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation there was a great earthquake, and an awful, horrifying crash of the Divinities’ <span class="add">thunder</span> drum.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc610"></a>Then venerable Anuruddha said this to the monks: “Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament, were you not warned by the Gracious One when he declared: ‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.’ How can it be otherwise, friends, for that which is obtained, born, become, in process, subject to dissolution?

<h3 class="add"><a id="42" href="#toc">42: The Preparation of the Body</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc615"></a>Then venerable Anuruddha and venerable Ānanda spent the rest of the night in talk about the Teaching. Then venerable Anuruddha addressed venerable Ānanda, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Go, Ānanda, and after entering Kusinārā inform the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘The Gracious One has attained Emancipation, Vāseṭṭhas, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc616"></a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to venerable Anuruddha, dressing in the morning time, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārā with a companion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc617"></a>Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall having some business <span class="add">or other</span>.

<p><a class="sc" id="sc618"></a>After hearing this word from venerable Ānanda, the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering. Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down <span class="add">as though</span> cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: “Too quickly the Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc619"></a>Then the Mallas from Kusinārā ordered <span class="add">their</span> men, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Now, friends, gather together perfume and flowers, and all the musicians in Kusinārā.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc620"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā, having taken perfumes and garlands, and all the musicians, and five-hundred pairs of clothes, approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, and the Gracious One’s body, after approaching the Gracious One’s body, through honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping <span class="add">the body</span>, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, and making cloth canopies, and preparing circular pavillions, they made the day pass.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc621"></a>Then this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “Today it is too late to burn the Gracious One’s body, tomorrow we will burn the Gracious One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc622"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā, through honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One’s body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, and making cloth canopies, and preparing circular pavillions, they made the second day pass, they made the third day pass, they made the fourth day pass, they made the fifth day pass, they made the sixth day pass.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc623"></a>Then on the seventh day this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “While honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One’s body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after taking it out of the city by the South, on the outside of the City to the South we will burn the Gracious One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc624"></a>Now at that time eight leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, <span class="add">said</span>: “Let us lift the Gracious One’s body,” but they were not able to lift <span class="add">it</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc625"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Anuruddha: “What is the reason, Anuruddha, what is the cause why eight leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, <span class="add">and saying</span>: ‘Let us lift the Gracious One’s body,’ are not able to lift <span class="add">it</span>?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc626"></a>“You Vāseṭṭhas have one intention, and the Divinities have another intention.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc627"></a>“But what is the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc628"></a>“Your intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is: ‘We, while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One’s body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after taking it out of the City by the South, on the outside of the City to the South, will burn the Gracious One’s body.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc629"></a>The Divinities’ intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is: ‘We, while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One’s body, with the Divinities’ dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after carrying it to the North of the City by the North, and re-entering the City by the North Gate, and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle, and going out by the Eastern Gate, to the East of the City, at the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet, there let us burn the Gracious One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc630"></a>“Let us do according to the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir.”</p>
<hr><p><a class="sc" id="sc631"></a>Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā, including the dirty rubbish heaps, was covered knee-deep with <span class="add">Divine</span> Coral Tree flowers. Then the Divinities and the Mallas of Kusinārā while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One’s body with the Divinities’ and mens’ dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after carrying it to the North of the City by the North, and re-entering the City by the North Gate, and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle, and going out by the Eastern Gate, to the East of the City, at the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet there set down the Gracious One’s body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc632"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Ānanda: “How do we act, reverend Ānanda, in regard to the Realised One’s body?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc633"></a>“As you act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body, so you should act in regard to the Realised One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc634"></a>“But how do we act, reverend Ānanda, in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc635"></a>“They wrap the Universal Monarch’s body, Vāseṭṭhas, with clean cloth, and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrap with carded cotton, and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrap with clean cloth, by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarch’s body with five-hundred pairs <span class="add">of cloth and cotton</span>, enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub, and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they burn the Universal Monarch’s body, and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc636"></a>So they act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body. Just as they act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body, so should they act in regard to a Realised One’s body, and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads. Whoever there prepares flowers, incense, or powder, or worships or establishes confidence in his mind, that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc637"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā gave orders to <span class="add">their</span> men, <span class="add">saying</span>: “If it is so <span class="add">then</span> wrap <span class="add">the body</span> with the Mallas’ carded cloth, friends.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc638"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā wrapped the Gracious One’s body with clean cloth, and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrapped with carded cotton, and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrapped with clean cloth, and by this means, after wrapping the Gracious One’s body with five-hundred pairs <span class="add">of cloth and cotton</span>, enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub, and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they put the Gracious One’s body on the funeral pyre.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="43" href="#toc">43: The Story concerning Mahākassapa</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc639"></a>Now at that time venerable Mahākassapa was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā, together with a great Community of monks, around five-hundred monks. Then venerable Mahākassapa, after descending from the path, sat down at the root of a certain tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc640"></a>Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka while holding a Mandārava flower from Kusinārā was travelling along the highway to Pāvā.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc642"></a>“Certainly, friend, I know. Today is seven days since the Final Emancipation of the ascetic Gotama, therefore I am holding this Mandārava flower.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc643"></a>Then those monks there who were not free from passion, some, throwing up their arms, were weeping, falling down <span class="add">as though</span> cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: ‘Too quickly the Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc644"></a>But those monks who were free from passion, mindfully, with full awareness, endured, <span class="add">thinking</span>: “Impermanent are <span class="add">all</span> processes, how can it be otherwise?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc645"></a>Now at that time one who had gone forth in old age, named Subhadda was sitting in that group. Then Subhadda, who had gone forth in old age, said this to those monks: “Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament, we are now freed from that troublesome Great Ascetic, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘This is allowable for you, this is not allowable for you.’ But now we will do whatever we wish, and we will not do whatever we do not wish.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc646"></a>Then venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks, <span class="add">saying</span>: “Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament, were you not warned by the Gracious One, friends, when he declared this: ‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.’ How can it be otherwise, friends, for that which is obtained, born, become, in process, subject to dissolution?

<p><a class="sc" id="sc647"></a>Now at that time four leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, <span class="add">said</span>: “Let us burn the Gracious One’s funeral pyre,” but they were not able to burn <span class="add">it</span>. Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Anuruddha: “What is the reason, venerable Anuruddha, what is the cause, why four leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, <span class="add">and saying</span>: ‘Let us burn the Gracious One’s funeral pyre,’ are not able to burn <span class="add">it</span>?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc648"></a>“The Divinities have another intention, Vāseṭṭhas.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc649"></a>“But what is the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc650"></a>“The Divinities’ intention, Vāseṭṭhas, <span class="add">is</span>: ‘The venerable Mahākassapa is travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a great Community of monks, around five-hundred monks, the Gracious One’s funeral pyre will not burn while venerable Mahākassapa has not worshipped the Gracious One’s feet with his head.’”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc651"></a>“Let us do according to the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc652"></a>Then venerable Mahākassapa approached Kusinārā, and the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet, and the Gracious One’s funeral pyre, and after approaching and arranging his robe on one shoulder, extending <span class="add">his hands</span> in respectful salutation, and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times, and uncovering the feet he worshipped the Gracious One’s feet with his head.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc653"></a>Also five-hundred monks, after arranging their robes on one shoulder, extending <span class="add">their hands</span> in respectful salutation, and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times, worshipped the Gracious One’s feet with their heads. After <span class="add">the Gracious One’s feet</span> had been worshipped by venerable Mahākassapa and by five-hundred monks the funeral pyre caught fire by itself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc654"></a>Now while the Gracious One’s body was burning, of the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, the sinews, the synovial fluid, neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over. Just as while ghee or oil is burning there is no charcoal and no ash evident, so when the Gracious One’s body was burning, of the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, the sinews, the synovial fluid, neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over. Only two of those five-hundred pairs of clothes were not consumed, that on the inside and that on the outside.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc655"></a>When the Gracious One’s body was burnt a shower of water appeared in the sky, and the Gracious One’s funeral pyre was extinguished. Also after water rose from a well, the Gracious One’s funeral pyre was extinguished. Also the Mallas from Kusinārā extinguished the Gracious One’s funeral pyre with all types of fragrant water.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc656"></a>Then the Mallas of Kusinārā, after making an enclosure of spears in the Council Hall, and surrounding the Gracious One’s bodily relics with bows, honoured, respected, revered, and worshipped <span class="add">it</span> with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes.</p>
<h3 class="add"><a id="44" href="#toc">44: The Distribution of the Relics</a></h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc657"></a>The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and I also am a Noble, I am worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, I will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc658"></a>Then the Licchavīs of Vesālī heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Licchavīs of Vesālī sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc659"></a>Then the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Sakyas of Kāpilavatthu sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was our foremost relative, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc660"></a>Then the Bulas of Allakappa heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Bulas of Allakappa sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc661"></a>Then the Koliyas of Rāmagāma heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Koliyas of Rāmagāma sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc662"></a>Then the brahmin Veṭhadīpaka heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the brahmin Veṭhadīpaka sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and I am a brahmin, I am worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, I will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc663"></a>Then the Mallas of Pāvā heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Mallas of Pāvā sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc664"></a>After this was said, the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to their community and group: “The Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation in the area of our village, <span class="add">but</span> we will not see a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc665"></a>After this was said, the brahmin Doṇa said this to their community and group:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc666"></a>“Listen, dear Sirs, to a sentence of mine:<br>
Our Buddha was one who spoke about forebearance<br>
It is not good that there should be a battle<br>
About sharing the relics of the Best Man.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc667"></a>Let us united, in concord, dear Sirs,<br>
With joyful minds, make eight shares <span class="add">of the relics</span>,<br>
And set up Shrines in every direction<br><span class="add">So that</span> many people may gain faith in the Visionary One.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc668"></a>“Now, brahmin, you must divide the Gracious One’s bodily relics in eight equal divisions.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc669"></a>“Certainly, dear Sir,” said Doṇa the brahmin, after replying to that community and group, and dividing the Gracious One’s bodily relics in eight equal divisions, he said this to that community and group: “Please give me this urn, dear Sirs, and I also will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the urn.” They gave the urn to Doṇa the brahmin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc670"></a>Then the Moriyā of Pepper Wood heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.” Then the Moriyā of Pepper Wood sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, <span class="add">saying</span>: “The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One’s bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc671"></a>“There are no more portions of the Gracious One’s relics, <span class="add">instead</span> take the ashes from the Gracious One’s body.” Therefore they took away the ashes.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc672"></a>Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, made a Shrine for the Gracious One’s bodily relics at Rājagaha and held a festival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc673"></a>The Licchavīs from Vesālī made a Shrine for the Gracious One’s bodily relics at Vesālī and held a festival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc674"></a>The Sakyas from Kapilavatthu made a Shrine for the Gracious One’s bodily relics at Kapilavatthu and held a festival.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="sc679"></a>The Mallas of Kusinārā made a Shrine for the Gracious One’s bodily relics at Kusinārā and held a festival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc680"></a>Doṇa the brahmin made a Shrine for the urn and held a festival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc681"></a>The Moriyās of Pepper Wood made a Shrine for the ashes at Pepper Wood and held a festival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc682"></a>Thus there were eight Shrines for the bodily relics, the Urn Shrine was the ninth, and the Ashes Shrine was the tenth, and so it was in former times.</p>
