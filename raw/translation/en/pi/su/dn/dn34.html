<h1>34. The Tenfold Series</h1>
</div>
<p><span class="evam">Thus have I heard.</span> The Exalted One was once staying at <i lang="pi" class="name">Campā</i>, on the banks of Lake Gaggara, with a great company of the brethren, about five hundred in number. There the venerable <i lang="pi" class="name">Sāriputta</i> addressed them, saying, ‘Friends, brethren!’</p>
<p>‘Yes, friend,’ responded the brethren.</p>
<p>And the venerable Sariputta spake thus:—</p>
<p>In groups from one to ten will I declare The Norm, that so ye may <i lang="pi" class="name">Nibbāna</i> win, That ye may make an end of ill and pain, That ye may be from every bond set free.</p>

He being thus, his mind does not incline (lit. bend) towards ardour, devotion, perserverance, exertion:—this is the first barrenness. (2–4) When he doubts, is perplexed about the Doctrine, the Order, the Training, these are, in order, the second, third and fourth barrennesses.

<p>vii. Which Five are hard to penetrate?</p>
<p>(1) The five elements favourable to deliverance, to wit, Herein, friends, when a brother is contemplating sensuous desires, his heart does not leap forward to them, nor rest complacent in them, does not choose them.</p>
<p>But when he is contemplating renunciation of them, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it.</p>
<p>This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from sense desires.</p>
<p>And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of sense-desires, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling.</p>
<p>This is pronounced to be the first deliverance.</p>
<p>(2) Again, friends, when a brother is contemplating [Ed.: thoughts of] ill will, his heart does not leap forward to them, nor rest complacent in them, does not choose them.</p>
<p>But when he is contemplating renunciation of them, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it.</p>
<p>This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from ill will.</p>
<p>And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of ill will, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling.</p>
<p>This is pronounced to be the second deliverance.</p>
<p>(3) Again, friends, when a brother is contemplating [Ed.: thoughts of] cruelty, his heart does not leap forward to them, nor rest complacent in them, does not choose them.</p>
<p>But when he is contemplating renunciation of them, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it.</p>
<p>This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from cruelty.</p>
<p>And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of cruelty, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling.</p>

<p>But when he is contemplating renunciation of them, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it.</p>
<p>This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from [Ed.: thoughts of] individuality.</p>
<p>And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of [Ed.: thoughts of] individuality, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling.</p>
<p>This is pronounced to be the fifth deliverance.</p>
<p>viii. Which Five are to be brought to pass?</p>
<p>The fivefold intuition of perfect concentration, to wit:—As a personal experience the intuition arises that (1) ‘this rapture is both a present happiness and a future result of happiness;’ (2) ‘this rapture is Ariyan, is unworldly;’ (3) ‘this rapture is not a pursuit of any but the noblest men;’ (4) ‘this rapture is good, excellent, has won tranquillization, has attained to mental uplift and concentration, and is not instigated nor opposed nor foiled; (5) ‘this rapture I myself with mental clarity attain, and from it with mental clarity emerge.’</p>
<p>ix. Which Five are to be thoroughly learnt?</p>
<p>The five occasions of emancipation, to wit: (1) Herein, when the Master, or a reverend fellow-disciple teaches the Norm to a brother, according as the teaching is given, the listener comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the first occasion.</p>
<p>(2) In the next place, a brother has a similar experience not from hearing the Master or a reverend fellow-disciple teach, but while himself teaching others the Norm in detail, as he has learnt and got it by memory and he comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the second occasion.</p>
<p>(3) In the third place, a brother has a similar experience, not on those first two occasions, but when he is reciting the doctrines of the Norm in detail as he has learnt and got them by memory and he comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the third occasion.</p>
<p>(4) In the fourth place, a brother has a similar experience, not on those first three occasions, but when he applies his thought to the Norm as he has learnt and got it by memory and he comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. and sustains protracted meditation on it and contemplates it in mind. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the fourth occasion.</p>
<p>(5) Finally, a brother has a similar experience, not on those first four occasions, but when he has well grasped some given clue to concentration, has well applied his understanding, has well thought it out, has well penetrated it by intuition.</p>
<p>And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the fifth occasion.</p>
<p>x. Which Five are to be realized?</p>
<p>The five bodies of doctrine, to wit, morals, concentrative exercise, insight, emancipation, knowledge and insight requisite for emancipation.</p>
<p>Now these Five Things are genuine, true, thus, not otherwise, not different, perfectly comprehended by the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Sixes</h4>
<p>There are Six things, friends, that helpeth much, Six things that are to be developed, Six things that are to be understood, Six things that are to be eliminated, Six things that belong to disaster, Six things that lead to distinction, Six things that are hard to penetrate, Six things that are to be brought to pass, Six things that are to be thoroughly learnt, Six things that are to be realized.</p>
<p>i. Which Six help much?</p>
<p>The six occasions of fraternal living, to wit: (1) Herein, friends, when a brother’s kindly act towards his fellow-disciples has been attested, as wrought publicly and in private, that is an occasion of fraternity, causing affection and regard, and conducing to concord, absence of strife, harmony, union.</p>
<p>(2–3) The second and third occasions are those of kindly speech and kind thoughts. (4) In the next place, when a brother who has honestly and righteously obtained gifts, distributes these impartially among his fellow-disciples, and has everything in common with them, even to the contents of his alms-bowl, that is an occasion of fraternity, etc. (5) Next, when the character and moral habits of a brother are without rupture or flaw, are consistently practised, unblemished, making a man free, commended by the wise, unperverted, and conducing to rapt concentration, and he, so virtuous, dwells openly and privately among his fellow-disciples, that is an occasion of fraternity, causing affection and regard, and conducing to concord, absence of strife, harmony, union. (6) Lastly, when a brother lives with his religious life [guided by] that Ariyan, safe-guarding belief, which leads him who so lives to the perfect destruction of sorrow,—when he thus equipped lives among his fellow-disciples publicly and in private, that is an occasion of fraternity … like the foregoing. ii. Which Six are to be developed?</p>
<p>The six matters for recollection, to wit, the Buddha, the Norm, the Order, the moral precepts, renunciation, the devas.</p>
<p>iii. Which Six are to be understood?</p>
<p>The six (organs of sense or) fields of personal experience, to wit, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and mind.</p>
<p>iv. Which Six are to be eliminated?</p>
<p>The six groups of cravings, to wit, the five kinds of sense-objects, and phenomena.</p>
<p>v. Which Six belong to decline?</p>
<p>The six forms of irreverence, to wit, Herein, friends, a brother conducts himself irreverently and insolently to the Master, the Norm, the Order, the training, or to his studies, or lacks in reverence and respect towards the duties of courtesy.</p>
<p>vi. Which Six belong to distinction?</p>
<p>The six forms of reverence, to wit, Herein, friends, a brother conducts himself in the opposite manner in the foregoing six cases.</p>
<p>vii. Which Six are hard to penetrate?</p>
<p>The six elements tending to deliverance, to wit, (1) Herein, friends, a brother might say: ‘Lo! I have developed mental emancipation by love, I have multiplied it, made it a vehicle, and a base.</p>
<p>I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless malevolence persistently possesses my heart.’ To him it should be said: ‘Not so! Say not so, your reverence! Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend. Things cannot be as you say. Emancipation of the heart through love, brother, this is how you become delivered from malevolence. (2–4) In the same way a brother might wrongly complain that after cultivating emancipation of the heart through pity, he was still possessed by cruelty, or that after cultivating emancipation of the heart through sympathetic joy, or through equanimity, he was still possessed by disgust, and passion respectively. (5) Next, friends, a brother might say: ‘Lo! I have developed mental emancipation from the power of any object to catch the fancy and incide lust, I have multiplied that emancipation, made it a vehicle and a base I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless my mind still pursues seductive objects. (6) Or again he may say: ‘Lo! the notion “I am” is offensive to me! I pay no heed to the notion “This ‘I’ exists!” Nevertheless doubts and queries and debating still possess my mind.’ To these answer should be made as before. He should be assured that such cannot really be the case; that it is by emancipating the heart through equanimity, or again, through the expulsion of the conceit of the existence of an ‘I,’ that he becomes delivered from lust and from doubts and queries and debatings. viii. Which Six are to be brought to pass?</p>
<p>The six chronic states, to wit, (1–5) Herein, friends, a brother on occasion of any of the five kinds of sensation, (6) as well as on that of any impression or idea, is neither delighted nor displeased, but remains equable, mindful and deliberate.</p>
<p>ix. Which Six are to be thoroughly learnt?</p>
<p>The six unsurpassable experiences, to wit, certain sights, certain things heard, certain gains, certain trainings, certain ministries, certain memories.</p>
<p>x. Which Six are to be realized?</p>
<p>The six superknowledges. Herein, friends, a brother (1) enjoys the wondrous gift in its various modes: — being one he becomes many, or having become many becomes one again; he becomes visible or invisible; he goes, feeling no obstruction, to the further side of a wall or rampart or hill, as if through air; he penetrates up and down through solid ground, as if through water; he walks on water without breaking through, as if on solid ground; he travels cross-legged in the sky, like the birds on wing; even the Moon and the Sun, so potent, so mighty though they be, does he touch and feel with his hand; he reaches in the body even up to the heaven of <i lang="pi" class="name">Brahmā</i>.</p>
<p>(2) With that clear Heavenly Ear surpassing the ear of men he hears sounds both human and celestial, whether far or near.</p>
<p>(3) Penetrating with his own heart the hearts of other beings, of other men, he knows them. He discerns—</p>
<p>The passionate mind to be passionate, and the calm mind calm; the angry mind to be angry, and the peaceful mind peaceful; the dull mind to be dull, and the alert mind alert; the attentive mind to be attentive, and the wandering mind wandering; the broad mind to be broad, and the narrow mind narrow; the mean mind to be mean, and the lofty mind lofty; the stedfast mind to be stedfast, and the wavering mind to be wavering; the free mind to be free, and the enslaved mind enslaved.</p>
<p>(4) He recalls to mind his various temporary states in days gone by—one birth, or two or three or four or five births, or ten or twenty or thirty or forty or fifty or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand births, through many an aeon of dissolution, many an aeon of evolution, many an aeon of both dissolution and evolution. “In such a place such was my name, such my family, such my caste, such my food, such my experience of discomfort or of ease, and such the limits of my life.</p>
<p>When I passed away from that state, I took form again in such a place. There I had such and such a name and family and caste and food and experience of discomfort or of ease, such was the limit of my life.</p>
<p>When I passed away from that state I took form again here.”—thus does he call to mind his temporary states in days gone by in all their details, and in all their modes.</p>
<p>(5) With the pure Heavenly Eye, surpassing that of men, he sees beings as they pass away from one form of existence and take shape in another; he recognises the mean and the noble, the well favoured and the ill favoured, the happy and the wretched, passing away according to their deeds: “Such and such beings, my brethren, evil-doers in act and word and thought, revilers of the noble ones, holding to wrong views, acquiring for themselves that Karma which results from wrong views, they, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in some unhappy state of suffering or woe.</p>
<p>But such and such beings, my brethren, well-doers in act and word and thought, not revilers of the noble ones, holding to right views, acquiring for themselves that Karma that results from right views, they, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in some happy state in heaven.”</p>
<p>Thus with the pure Heavenly Eye, surpassing that of men, he sees beings as they pass away from one state of existence, and take form in another; he recognises the mean and the noble, the well favoured and the ill favoured, the happy and the wretched, passing away according to their deeds.</p>
<p>(6) he lives in the attainment, the personal knowledge and realization, through the extinction of the intoxicants, of sane and immune freedom of heart and mind.</p>
<p>Now these Six Things are genuine, true, thus, not otherwise, not different, perfectly comprehended by the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>.</p>
<hr>

<p>iii. Which Seven are to be understood?</p>
<p>Seven stations of consciousness.</p>
<p>(1) There are beings, brethren, who are diverse both in body and in mind, such as mankind, certain devas and some who have gone to an evil doom. This is the first station (or persistence) for [re-born] consciousness. (2) Other beings are diverse of body, but uniform in mind, such as the devas of the Brahma-world, reborn there from [practice here of] first [ <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>]. (3) Others are uniform in body, diverse in intelligence, such as the Radiant Devas. (4) Others are uniform both in body and in intelligence, such as the All-Lustrous Devas. (5) Others there are who, by having passed wholly beyond all consciousness of matter, by the dying out of the consciousness of sense-reaction, by having turned the attention away from any consciousness of the manifold and become conscious only of ‘space as infinite’ are dwellers in the realm of infinite space. (6) Others there are who, by having passed wholly beyond the realm of infinite space and become conscious only of consciousness as infinite are dwellers in the realm of infinite consciousness. (7) Others there are who, having passed wholly beyond the realm of infinite consciousness, and become conscious only that ‘there is nothing whatever,’ are dwellers in the realm of nothingness. Such are the remaining stations of consciousness.</p>

<p>viii. Which Seven are to be brought to pass?</p>
<p>The seven perceptions, to wit, that of impermanence, of soullessness, of ugliness, of evil [in the world], of elimination, of passionlessness, of cessation.</p>
<p>ix. Which Seven are to be thoroughly understood?</p>
<p>The seven bases of arahantship.</p>
<p>Herein, friends, a brother is keenly desirous of entering the training, and longs to continue doing so. He feels similarly with regard to insight into the doctrine, to the suppression of hankerings, to [the need of] solitude, to evoking energy, to mindfulness and perspicacity, to intuition of the truth. x. Which Seven are to be realized?</p>
<p>The seven powers of the Arahant. Herein, friends, for a brother who is Arahant</p>
<p>(1) the impermanence of all conditioned things is well seen as it really is by perfect insight. This is one of his powers, on account of which he recognizes that for him the ‘Intoxicants’ are destroyed. (2) That sensuous worldly desires are like coals of fire” is well seen as it really is etc… . (as above) destroyed. (3) His heart is inclined to, set upon detachment; he has made detachment its mountain-cave, its object; his heart loves renunciation, and has become entirely non-existent for all opportunities of incoming intoxicants. This is one, etc. … (4) the four applications of mindfulness have been developed and well developed. This, etc. … (5) so also for the five spiritual faculties, (6) the seven factors of enlightenment, (7) the Ariyan Eightfold Path. In that this and those have been developed and well developed, these are powers of the Arahant brother, on account of which he recognizes that for him the ‘Intoxicants’ are destroyed.</p>
<p>Now these Seven Things are genuine, true, thus, not otherwise, not different, perfectly comprehended by the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>.</p>
<p class="endsection">Here endeth the first Portion for Recitation.</p>
<h4>Eights</h4>
<p>There are Eight things, friends, that helpeth much, Eight things that are to be developed, Eight things that are to be understood, Eight things that are to be eliminated, Eight things that belong to disaster, Eight things that lead to distinction, Eight things that are hard to penetrate, Eight things that are to be brought to pass, Eight things that are to be thoroughly learnt, Eight things that are to be realized.</p>
<p>i. Which Eight help much?</p>
<p>The eight conditions, the eight causes which conduce to attaining that wisdom in those fundamentals of religious life which have not been attained, to multiplying, expanding, developing, perfecting those that have been attained. Herein, friends, (1) one dwells near the Master, or near a fellow-disciple occupying the place of teacher, whereby he is strongly established in conscientiousness, prudence, love, and respect. (2) Under such circumstances he approaches his teachers from time to time and asks and considers, saying: ‘Lord, how is this? What does this mean?’ And to him those reverend ones reveal what is hidden, make plain what is obscure, and dispel any doubts in perplexing matters.</p>
<p>(3) When he has heard their doctrine, he succeeds in obtaining a double serenity, that of body and of mind. (4) Moreover, friends, a brother, virtuous, habitually self-restrained with the self-restraint of the Canon law, proficient in behaviour and propriety, seeing danger in the smallest offence, undertakes to train himself in the stages of the training. This is the fourth condition, the eighth cause of such as conduce to attaining that wisdom in the fundamentals of religious life which have not been attained, to multiplying, expanding, developing, perfecting those that have been attained. (5) Moreover, friends, a brother having learnt much, bears what he has heard in mind and stores it up. And whatever doctrines, lovely in the beginning, in the middle, at the end, both in the letter and in the spirit, commend a religious life that is absolutely fulfilled and made quite pure, those doctrines are by such a brother much learnt, remembered, treasured by repetition, pondered in mind, well penetrated by intuition. This is the fifth condition, the eighth cause of such as conduce to attaining that wisdom in the fundamentals of religious life which have not been attained, to multiplying, expanding, developing, perfecting those that have been attained. (6) Moreover, friends, a brother is habitually stirring up energy for the elimination of bad qualities, the evoking of good qualities, indomitable, strongly progressing and never shirking with respect to what is good. This is the sixth condition, the eighth cause of such as conduce to attaining that wisdom in the fundamentals of religious life which have not been attained, to multiplying, expanding, developing, perfecting those that have been attained. (7) Moreover, friends, he is clear-minded, supremely heedful and discriminating, noting and remembering what has long since been done and spoken. This is the seventh condition, the eighth cause of such as conduce to attaining that wisdom in the fundamentals of religious life which have not been attained, to multiplying, expanding, developing, perfecting those that have been attained. (8) Moreover, friends, a brother is habitually contemplating the rise and passing away of the five aggregates of grasping, to wit: ‘Such is the material [aggregate], such its cause, its cessation.’ Similarly for the four mental aggregates. This is the eighth condition, the eighth cause of such as conduce to attaining that wisdom in the fundamentals of religious life which have not been attained, to multiplying, expanding, developing, perfecting those that have been attained. ii. Which Eight are to be developed?</p>
<p>The Aryan Eightfold Path, to wit, right views, intentions, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration .</p>
<p>iii. Which Eight are to be understood?</p>
<p>Eight matters of worldly concern, to wit, gains and losses, fame and obscurity, blame and praise, pleasures and pains.</p>

<p>Eight wrong factors of character and conduct, to wit, wrong views, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration.</p>
<p>v. Which Eight belonging to decline?</p>
<p>Eight bases of slackness.</p>
<p>Herein, friends, (1) let a brother have some work to do. He thinks: ‘There’s that work I have to do, but the doing of it will tire me. Well then, I shall lie down.’ He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (2) Or he has been working, and thinks: ‘I have been working, and the doing of my work has tired me. Well then, I shall lie down.’ He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (3) Or he has to make a journey, and he thinks: ‘I have to make a journey, and that will tire me. Well then, I shall lie down.’ He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (4) Or he has gone on his journey, and reflects: ‘I have gone on a journey, and that has tired me. Well then, I shall lie down.’ He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (5) Or he tours about a village or township for alms and does not obtain his fill of poor or rich food, and thinks: ‘I’ve gone about village, about township for alms and have not obtained my fill of poor or rich food. This body of me is tired and good for naught. Well then, I’ll lie down.’ He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (6) Or he tours about a village or township for alms and does obtain his fill of poor or rich food and thinks: ‘I’ve gone about a village or township for alms and have obtained my fill of poor or rich food. This body of me is heavy and good for naught, seems tome like a load of soaked beans. Well then, I’ll lie down’ He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (7) Or in him some slight ailment has arisen, and he thinks: In this state it is fit I lie down. He lies down; he stirs up no energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. (8) Or he has recovered from illness, has recently arisen from some indisposition. And he thinks his body is weak and good for naught and lies down nor stirs up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.</p>
<p>vi. Which Eight belonging to distinction?</p>
<p>Eight bases of setting afoot an undertaking.</p>
<p>Herein, brethren, (1) let a brother have some work to do. He thinks: ‘There is that work I have to do, but in doing it, I shall not find it easy to attend to the religion of the Buddhas. Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (2) Or he has done a task, and thinks: ‘I have been working, but I could not attend to the religion of the Buddhas. Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (3) Or he has to go on a journey, and thinks it will not be easy for him, on his way, to attend to the religion of the Buddhas, and resolves: ‘Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (4) Or he has been on a journey, but has not been able to attend to the religion of the Buddhas, and resolves: Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (5) Or he has toured about village or township for alms and has not obtained his fill of poor or rich food. And he thinks that, under the circumstances, his body is light and fit for work and resolves: Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (6) Or he has toured and has obtained his fill and thinks that, under the circumstances, his body is strong and fit to work and resolves: Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (7) Or in him some slight ailment has arisen. And he thinks it is possible that the ailment may grow worse, so that he must stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ (8) Or he has recovered from illness, has recently arisen from some indisposition. And he thinks: I have recovered from illness, I have recently arisen from my indisposition. It is possible that the illness may recur. Well then, I will stir up energy to finish that which is not done, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.’ . vii. Which Eight are hard to penetrate?</p>
<p>Eight untimely unseasonable intervals for life in a religious order, (1) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme.</p>
<p>The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And this person is reborn at that time in purgatory. This is the first untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (2) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And this person is reborn at that time in the animal kingdom. This is the second untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (3) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And this person is reborn at that time among the Petas. This is the third untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (4) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And this person is reborn at that time among some longlived deva community. This is the fourth untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (5) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And this person is reborn at that time in the border countries among unintelligent barbarians, where there is no opening for members of the Order or lay-brethren. This is the fifth untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (6) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And this person is reborn at that time in the middle countries, but he holds wrong opinions and has perverted vision, holding that gifts, offerings, oblations are as naught, for thhere is no fruit nor result of deeds well or ill done; there are no parents nor birth without them; there are no recluses or brahmins in the world who have attained the highest, leading perfect lives, and who, havintg known and realized each for himself the truth as to this and the next world, do reveal it. This is the sixth untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (7) A <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer. And though reborn at the time in the Middle countries, he is stupid, dull, or deaf and dumb, unable to know whether a matter has been well said or ill said. This is the seventh untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order. (8) Or finally, friends, a <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i> has not arisen in the world as Arahant Buddha Supreme, the Norm is not taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, as revealed by the Well-Farer; and this person is [in that interval] reborn in the Middle country, is intelligent, bright of wit, nor deaf-mute, able to know whether a matter has been well said or ill said. This is the eighth untimely, unsseasonable period for living in a religious order.</p>
<p>viii. Which Eight are to be brought to pass?</p>
<p>The eight thoughts of a superman.</p>
<p>This Norm is for one of little wants, not for one of great wants; for one who is serenely content, not for the discontented; for one who is detached, not for one who is fond of society; for one who is energetic, not for the slacker; for one who has presence of mind, not a confused mind; for one whose mind is concentrated, not distracted; for one who has insight, not for the unintelligent; for one who delights not in conceit, craving and opinion, not for one who delights therein.</p>
<p>ix. Which Eight are to be thoroughly learnt?</p>
<p>Eight positions of mastery.</p>
<p>(1) When anyone pictures to himself some material feature of his person and sees [corresponding] features in others, lovely or ugly, as small, transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so, [thinks] ‘I know, I see!’ (2) Or when he has the same experience, but sees those features not as small, but as infinitely great, and nevertheless transcending this [object], and is aware of doing so [thinks]: ‘I know, I see!’ (3) Or when he sees the features in others lovely or ugly, as small, without first picturing any material feature of his own transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so, [thinks] ‘I know, I see!’ (4) Or when he sees the features in others but sees those features not as small, but as infinitely great, and nevertheless transcending this [object], and is aware of doing so [thinks]: ‘I know, I see!’ (5) Or when without the personal preliminary, he sees external shapes of indigo, indigo in colour, indigo in visible expanse, indigo in lustre, as is the <i lang="pi" class="name">ummā</i> flower, or a Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so, [thinks] ‘I know, I see!’ (6) or shapes of yellow yellow in colour, yellow in visible expanse, yellow in lustre, as is the <i lang="pi" class="name">kaṇikāra</i> flower, or Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so, [thinks] ‘I know, I see!’ (7) or shapes of red red in colour, red in visible expanse, red in lustre, as is the <i lang="pi" class="name">bandhujīvaka</i> flower, or Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so, [thinks] ‘I know, I see!’ (8) or shapes of white, white in color, white in visible expanse, white in lustre as is the morning star, or Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides transcends this [object] and is aware of doing so, [thinks]: ‘I know, I see!’</p>
<p>x. Which Eight are to be realized?</p>
<p>Eight deliverances, to wit, (1) He, picturing any material feature of himself, sees such material features [as they really are]. (2) Not picturing any such, he sees material features external to his own. (3) He decides that it is beautiful. (4) By passing wholly beyond all consciousness of material qualities, by the dying out of the awareness of sensory reaction, by the unheeding of any awareness of difference, he enters into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which is a consciousness of infinite space. (5) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness, he enters into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which is a consciousness of infinitude of consciousness itself. (6) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness, he enters into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which regards consciousness itself as nothing whatever, a sphere of nothingness. (7) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere, he enters into and abides in that rapt consciousness which neither is, nor yet is not to be called conscious. (8) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere, he enters into and abides in a state of unconsciousness, wherein awareness and feeling cease.</p>
<p>Now these Eight Things are genuine, true, thus, not otherwise, not different, perfectly comprehended by the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>.</p>
<h4>Nines</h4>
<p>There are Nine things, friends, that helpeth much, Nine things that are to be developed, Nine things that are to be understood, Nine things that are to be eliminated, Nine things that belong to disaster, Nine things that lead to distinction, Nine things that are hard to penetrate, Nine things that are to be brought to pass, Nine things that are to be thoroughly learnt, Nine things that are to be realized.</p>
<p>i. Which Nine help much?</p>
<p>The nine states of mind and body which are rooted in orderly thinking :—To one so thinking, gladness arises, in him gladdened, rapture arises, his mind enraptured the body is satisfied, one whose body is thus appeased is at ease, he being happily at ease, the mind is stayed, with mind thus stayed, concentrated, he knows he sees [things] as they really are, and he thus knowing thus seeing turns in repulsion, repelled he becomes passionless; hence he is set free.</p>
<p>ii. Which Nine are to be developed?</p>
<p>The nine factors in wrestling for utter purity, to wit, the purification of morals, of the mind, of views, the purification of escaping from doubt, that of intuition and insight into what is the [genuine] path, and what is not, that of intuition and insight into progress, the purification which is intuition and insight, that which is understanding, that which is emancipation.</p>
<p>iii. Which Nine are to be understood?</p>
<p>Nine spheres inhabited by beings.</p>
<p>(1) ‘There are beings differing in body and differing in intelligence, for instance, human beings and certain of the gods and some of those in purgatory. This is the first resting place for Cognition. (2) ‘There are beings differing in body but of uniform intelligence, for instance, the gods of the Brahma-heaven who are there reborn by means of the First [ <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>]. This is the second resting-place for Cognition. (3) ‘There are beings uniform in body and differing in intelligence, for instance, the Luminous Gods. This is the third resting place for Cognition. (4) ‘There are beings uniform in body and of uniform intelligence, for instance, the All-Lustrous Gods. This is the fourth resting place for Cognition.’. (5) There are beings without perception or feeling. These live in the sphere of the ‘unconscious devas.’ (6) There are beings who having passed wholly beyond awareness of material qualities, by the dying out of sensory reaction, by unheeding the awareness of difference, have attained to the sphere of infinite space with a consciousness thereof, (7) by passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness, enter into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which is a consciousness of infinitude of consciousness itself, (8) by passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness, enter into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which regards consciousness itself as nothing whatever, a sphere of nothingness, (9) by passing wholly beyond such a sphere, enter into and abides in that rapt consciousness which neither is, nor yet is not to be called conscious.</p>
<p>iv. Which Nine are to be eliminated?</p>
<p>The nine things springing from craving, to wit, pursuit caused by craving, gain because of pursuit, decision because of gain, desire and passion because of decision, tenacity because of desire and passion, possession because of tenacity, avarice because of possession, watch and ward because of avarice, and many a bad and wicked state of things arising from keeping watch and ward over possessions:—blows and wounds, strife, contradiction and retort, quarrelling, slander and lies.</p>
<p>v. Which Nine are belong to decline?</p>
<p>Nine bases of quarrelling, thus:—quarrelling is stirred up at the thought: ‘he has done me an injury,’ or ‘he is doing me an injury,’ or ‘he will do me an injury,’ or ‘he has done, is doing, will do an injury to one I love,’ or ‘he has bestowed a benefit, is bestowing, will bestow a benefit on one I dislike.’ .</p>
<p>vi. Which Nine are belong to distinction?</p>
<p>Nine suppressions of quarrelling, thus:—quarrelling is suppressed by the thought: ‘He has done, is doing, will do me an injury, or ‘he has done, is doing, will do an injury to one I love’, or ‘he has bestowed, is bestowing, will bestow a benefit on one I dislike’, true, but what gain would there be to either of us if I quarrelled about it?’</p>
<p>vii. Which Nine are hard to penetrate?</p>
<p>The nine differences:—on account of difference in the [sensory] element, a different contact takes place, on account of difference in contact difference in feeling arises, hence difference in perception, hence difference in purposive thought, hence difference in active desire, hence difference in greed, hence difference in pursuit, hence difference in gain.</p>
<p>viii. Which Nine are to be brought to pass?</p>
<p>The nine perceptions, to wit, perception of ugliness, of death, revulsion from nutriment (physical, sensory, mental), disaffection with everything worldly, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, no-soul in that which suffers, elimination, passionlessness.</p>
<p>ix. Which Nine are to be thoroughly learnt?</p>
<p>Herein, friends, a brother, (1) aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, wherein there is initiative and sustained thought, which is born of solitude, and is full of zest and ease.</p>
<p>(2) Secondly, when suppressing initiative and sustained thought, he enters into and abides in the Second <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, which is self-evoked, born of concentration, full of zest and ease, in that, set free from initial and sustined thought, the mind grows calm and sure, dwelling on high. (3) Thirdly, when a brother, no longer fired with zest, abides calmly contemplative, while mindful and self-possessed he feels in his body that ease whereof Ariyans declare: He that is calmly contemplative and aware, he dwelleth at ease, so does he enter into and abide in the Third <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>. (4) Fourthly, by putting aside ease and by putting aside malaise, by the passing away of the joy and the sorrow he used to feel, he enters into and abides in the Fourth <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, rapture of utter purity of mindfulness and equanimity, wherein neither ease is felt nor any ill. (5) By passing wholly beyond all consciousness of material qualities, by the dying out of the awareness of sensory reaction, by the unheeding of any awareness of difference, he enters into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which is a consciousness of infinite space. (6) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness, he enters into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which is a consciousness of infinitude of consciousness itself. (7) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness, he enters into and abides in that rapt ecstasy which regards consciousness itself as nothing whatever, a sphere of nothingness. (8) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere, he enters into and abides in that rapt consciousness which neither is, nor yet is not to be called conscious. (9) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere, he enters into and abides in a state of unconsciousness, wherein awareness and feeling cease. x. Which Nine are to be realized?</p>
<p>The nine successional cessations, thus:—Taking each of the foregoing nine in order, by the attainment of (1) First <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, sensuous perceptions cease, (2) Second <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, applied and sustained thought ceases, (3) Third <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, zest ceases, (4) Fourth <i lang="pi">Jhāna</i>, respiration ceases, (5) by the perception of infinite space, perception of material things ceases, (6) by the perception of infinite consciousness, perception of infinite space ceases, (7) by the perception of nothingness, perception of infinite consciousness ceases, (8) by the perception that is neither conscious nor yet unconscious, perception of nothingness ceases, (9) by the cessation of perception and feeling, perception that is neither conscious nor yet unconscious ceases.</p>
<p>Now these Nine Things are genuine, true, thus, not otherwise, not different, perfectly comprehended by the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>.</p>
<h4>Tens</h4>
<p>There are Ten things, friends, that helpeth much, Ten things that are to be developed, Ten things that are to be understood, Ten things that are to be eliminated, Ten things that belong to disaster, Ten things that lead to distinction.</p>
<p>Ten things that are hard to penetrate, Ten things that are to be brought to pass. Ten things that are to be thoroughly learnt, Ten things that are to be realized.</p>

(9) Furthermore, friends, he is mindful, and possessed of supreme lucidity and perspicacity in following mentally and recollecting deeds and words long past. (10) Furthermore,friends, he is intelligent, endowed withinsight into the rise and passing away [of things], insight which is of that Ariyan penetration which leads to the complete destruction of pain. (as detailed in X, i onwards of the Sangiti Sutta).</p>
<p>ii. Which Ten must be developed?</p>
<p>Ten objects for self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>These, perceived severally as above, below or across, and as homogeneous, and without limits, are a piece of earth [extended matter], water, fire, air, indigo, yellow, red, white, space, consciousness. (as detailed in X, ii onwards of the Sangiti Sutta).</p>

<p>vii. Which Ten are hard to perpetrate?</p>
<p>Ten Ariyan methods of living.</p>
<p>Herein, friends, a brother has got rid of five factors, is possessed of six factors, has set the one guard, carries out the four bases of observance, has put away sectarian opinions, has utterly given up quests, is candid in his thoughts, has calmed the restlessness of his body, and is well emancipated in heart and intellect. (1) What five factors has he got rid of? Sensuality, malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and worry, doubt. (2) What six factors is he possessed of? The six ‘chronic states.’ Herein, friends, a brother on occasion (1–5) of any of the five kinds of sensation, (6) as well as on that of any impression or idea, is neither delighted nor displeased, but remains equable, mindful and deliberate. (See p. 234) (3) How has he set the one guard? By the mental guard of mindfulness. (4) What are the four bases of observance? Herein a brother judges that something is to be habitually pursued, endured, avoided, suppressed. (5) How does he become ‘one who has put away sectarian opinions?

(9) How does he become well emancipated in heart? He becomes emancipated in heart from passion, hate, and illusion. (10) How does he become well emancipated in intellect? He understands his emancipated condition, namely, in the thought: Passion for me is eliminated, cut off at the root, become as a palmtree stump, become non-existent, unable to grow again in future. Hate for me is eliminated, cut off at the root, become as a palmtree stump, become non-existent, unable to grow again in future. Illusion for me is eliminated, cut off at the root, become as a palmtree stump, become non-existent, unable to grow again in future.</p>

<p>The ten perceptions, to wit, perception of ugliness, of death, revulsion from nutriment (physical, sensory, mental), disaffection with everything worldly, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, no-soul in that which suffers, elimination, passionlessness, and of cessation.</p>
<p>ix. Which Ten are to be thoroughly learnt?</p>
<p>The ten causes of wearing away:—by right views wrong views are worn away; whatever manifold bad and wicked qualities, proceeding from those wrong views, take shape, they are worn away in you.</p>
<p>And many good qualities, caused by right views, become developed and brought to perfection. The same wearing away is wrought by the other nine factors of the tenfold Path on the opposed nine wrong factors of character and conduct.</p>
<p>x. Which Ten are to be realized?</p>
<p>Ten qualities belonging to the adept, to wit, the right (or perfect) views, intentions, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration, insight and emancipation as held by adepts.</p>
<p>Now these Ten Things are genuine, true, thus, not otherwise, not different, perfectly comprehended by the <i lang="pi" class="name">Tathāgata</i>.</p>
<p>Thus spake the venerable Sariputta. And pleased in mind those brethren delighted in his words.</p>
