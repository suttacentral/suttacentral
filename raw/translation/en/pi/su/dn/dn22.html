<p>“This is a one-way path, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of grief and lamentation, for the extinction of pain and sorrow, for attaining the right way, for the direct realisation of Nibbāna, that is to say, the four ways of attending to mindfulness.</p>
<p>Which four?</p>

<h3>The Section about the Four Truths</h3>
<p>Moreover, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the Four Noble Truths?</p>
<p>Here, monks, a monk knows as it really is “this is Suffering ”, he knows as it really is “this is the Origination of Suffering ”, he knows as it really is “this is the Cessation of Suffering ”, he knows as it really is “this is the Practice Leading to the Cessation of Suffering ”.</p>
<h4>The Truth of Suffering</h4>
<p>Now what, monks, is the Noble Truth of Suffering?</p>
<p>Birth is suffering also old age is suffering also death is suffering also grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair, is suffering also being joined to what is not liked is suffering, also being parted from what is liked is suffering, also not to obtain that which one longs for is suffering in brief, the five constituents (of mind and body) that provide fuel for attachment are suffering.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is birth?</p>
<p>For the various beings in the various classes of beings (there is) birth, being born, appearing, turning up; the manifestation of the constituents (of mind and body), the acquisition of the sense spheres: this, monks, is called birth.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is old age?</p>
<p>For the various beings in the various classes of beings there is old age, agedness, broken teeth, greying hair, and wrinkled skin; the dwindling away of the life span, the decay of the sense faculties: this, monks, is called old age.</p>

<p>Now what, monks, is the suffering from not obtaining what one longs for?</p>
<p>To those beings subject to birth, monks, a longing like this arises: “Oh, might we not be subject to birth, may birth not come to us!” But that cannot be attained merely by longing for it: this is the suffering from not obtaining what one longs for.</p>
<p>To those beings subject to old age, monks, a longing like this arises:</p>

<p>Now what, monks, in brief, are the five constituents (of mind and body) that provide fuel for attachment which are suffering?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<p>the form constituent that is fuel for attachment</p>
<p>the feelings constituent that is fuel for attachment</p>
<p>the perceptions constituent that is fuel for attachment</p>

<p>the consciousness constituent that is fuel for attachment .</p>
<p>These, monks, are called, in brief, the five constituents (of mind and body) that provide fuel for attachment which are suffering.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called the Noble Truth of Suffering.</p>

<p>This, monks, is called the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Path</h3>
<p>Now what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Practice Leading to the Cessation of Suffering?</p>
<p>It is this noble path with eight factors, as follows: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood right endeavour, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right view?</p>
<p>That, monks, which is knowledge about suffering knowledge about the origination of suffering knowledge about the cessation of suffering knowledge about the practice leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right view.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right thought?</p>
<p>The thought of renunciation, the thought of good-will, the thought of non-violence.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right thought.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right speech?</p>
<p>Refraining from false speech refraining from malicious speech refraining from rough speech refraining from frivolous talk.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right speech.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right action?</p>
<p>Refraining from killing living creatures refraining from taking what has not been given refraining from sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right action.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right livelihood?</p>
<p>Here, monks, a noble disciple, having abandoned a wrong way of livelihood, makes his living by a right way of livelihood.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right livelihood.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right endeavour?</p>
<p>Here, monks, a monk regarding bad and unwholesome thoughts that have not yet arisen generates desire for their non-arising, (in this regard) he endeavours, instigates energy, exerts his mind, and makes an effort.</p>
<p>Regarding bad and unwholesome things that have already arisen he generates desire for their abandonment, (in this regard) he endeavours, instigates energy, exerts his mind, and makes an effort.</p>
<p>He generates desire for the arising of wholesome things that have not yet arisen, (in this regard) he endeavours, instigates energy, exerts his mind, and makes an effort.</p>
<p>Regarding wholesome things that have arisen he generates desire for their endurance, persistence, multiplication, extension, development, and fulfilment, (in this regard) he endeavours, instigates energy, exerts his mind, and makes an effort.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right endeavour.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right mindfulness?</p>
<p>Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p>He dwells contemplating (the nature of) feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p>He dwells contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p>He dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right mindfulness.</p>
<p>Now what, monks, is right concentration?</p>
<p>Here, monks, a monk, quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from unwholesome things, having thinking, reflection, and the happiness and joy born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption.</p>
<p>With the calming down of thinking and reflection, with internal clarity, and one-pointedness of mind, being without thinking, without reflection, having the happiness and joy born of concentration, he dwells having attained the second absorption.</p>
<p>With the fading away of joy he dwells equanimous, mindful, fully aware, experiencing happiness through the body, about which the Noble Ones declare: “He dwells pleasantly, mindful, and equanimous,” he dwells having attained the third absorption.</p>
<p>Having abandoned pleasure, abandoned pain, and with the previous passing away of mental happiness and sorrow, without pain, without pleasure, and with complete purity of mindfulness owing to equanimity, he dwells having attained the fourth absorption.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called right concentration.</p>
<p>This, monks, is called the Noble Truth of the Practice Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself and in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in things, or else mindfulness that “there are these (various) things” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness, and he dwells independent, and without being attached to anything in the world.</p>
<p>In this way, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the Four Noble Truths.</p>
