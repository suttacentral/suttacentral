</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you a Dhamma exposition on the theme of the hundred and eight. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma exposition on the theme of the hundred and eight? I have spoken of two kinds of feelings by <span class="add">one</span> method of exposition; I have spoken of three kinds of feelings by <span class="add">another</span> method of exposition; I have spoken of five kinds of feelings … six kinds of feelings … eighteen kinds of feelings … thirty-six kinds of feelings by <span class="add">another</span> method of exposition; and I have spoken of one hundred and eight kinds of feelings by <span class="add">still another</span> method of exposition.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of feelings? Bodily and mental. These are called the two kinds of feelings. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.232"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of feelings? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These are called the three kinds of feelings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>And what, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of feelings? The pleasure faculty, the pain faculty, the joy faculty, the displeasure faculty, the equanimity faculty. These are called the five kinds of feelings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the six kinds of feelings? Feeling born of eye-contact … feeling born of mind-contact. These are called the six kinds of feeling.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the eighteen kinds of feelings? Six examinations accompanied by joy, six examinations accompanied by displeasure, six examinations accompanied by equanimity. These are called the eighteen kinds of feelings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the thirty-six kinds of feelings? Six types of joy based on the household life, six types of joy based on renunciation; six types of displeasure based on the household life, six types of displeasure based on renunciation; six types of equanimity based on the household life, six types of equanimity based on renunciation. These are called the thirty-six kinds of feelings. “And what, bhikkhus, are the hundred and eight kinds of feelings? The <span class="add">above</span> thirty-six feelings in the past, the <span class="add">above</span> thirty-six feelings in the future, the <span class="add">above</span> thirty-six feelings at present. These are called the hundred and eight kinds of feelings.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma exposition on the theme of the hundred and eight.”</p>
