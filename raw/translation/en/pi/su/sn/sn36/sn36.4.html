<h1>4. The Bottomless Abyss</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed worldling makes the statement, ‘In the great ocean there is a bottomless abyss,’ he makes such a statement about something that is nonexistent and unreal. This, bhikkhus, is rather a designation for painful bodily feelings, that is, ‘bottomless abyss.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“When the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a painful bodily feeling, he sorrows, grieves, and laments; he weeps and beats his breast and becomes distraught. This is called an uninstructed worldling who has not risen up in the bottomless abyss, one who has not gained a foothold.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“But, bhikkhus, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful bodily feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament; he does not weep and beat his breast and become distraught. This is called an instructed noble disciple who has risen up in the bottomless abyss, one who has gained a foothold.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>One who cannot endure<br>
The arisen painful feelings,<br>
Bodily feelings that sap one’s life,<br>
Who trembles when they touch him,<br>
A weakling of little strength<br>
Who weeps out loud and wails:<br>
He has not risen up in the bottomless abyss,<br>
Nor has he even gained a foothold. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.207"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>But one who is able to endure them—<br>
The arisen painful feelings,<br>
Bodily feelings that sap one’s life—<br>
Who trembles not when they touch him:<br>
He has risen up in the bottomless abyss,<br>
And he has also gained a foothold.</p>
