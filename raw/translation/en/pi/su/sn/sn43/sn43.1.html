<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the unconditioned? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this is called the unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the unconditioned? Mindfulness directed to the body: this is called the path leading to the unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Thus, bhikkhus, I have taught you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned. Whatever should be done, bhikkhus, by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, desiring their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, bhikkhus, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be negligent, lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.360"></a></p>
