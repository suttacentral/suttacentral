<h1>21. Koṭigama (1)</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Koṭigama. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of saṃsara. What four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of saṃsara. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering … the noble truth of the cessation of suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.432"></a> that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of saṃsara.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“That noble truth of suffering, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated. That noble truth of the origin of suffering has been understood and penetrated. That noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated. That noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Because of not seeing as they are<br>
The Four Noble Truths,<br>
We have wandered through the long course<br>
In the various kinds of births.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Now these truths have been seen;<br>
The conduit to existence is severed;<br>
Cut off is the root of suffering:<br>
Now there is no more renewed existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
