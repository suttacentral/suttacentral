<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Paṭaliputta. “Friend Ānanda, it is said, ‘the holy life, the holy life.’ What now, friend, is the holy life, and who is a follower of the holy life, and what is the final goal of the holy life?” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.17"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Good, good, friend Bhadda! Your intelligence is excellent, friend Bhadda, your ingenuity is excellent, your inquiry is a good one. For you have asked me: ‘Friend Ānanda, it is said, “the holy life, the holy life.” What now, friend, is the holy life, and who is a follower of the holy life, and what is the final goal of the holy life?’”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“This Noble Eightfold Path, friend, is the holy life; that is, right view … right concentration. One who possesses this Noble Eightfold Path is called a liver of the holy life. The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is the final goal of the holy life.”</p>
