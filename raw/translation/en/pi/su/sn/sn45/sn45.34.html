<h1>34. Going Beyond</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, these eight things, when developed and cultivated, lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore. What eight? Right view … right concentration. These eight things, when developed and cultivated, lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Few are those among humankind<br>
Who go beyond to the far shore.<br>
The rest of the people merely run<br>
Up and down along the bank.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“When the Dhamma is rightly expounded<br>
Those who practise in accord with the Dhamma<br>
Are the people who will go beyond<br>
The realm of Death so hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Having left behind the dark qualities,<br>
The wise man should develop the bright ones.<br>
Having come from home into homelessness,<br>
Where it is hard to take delight—</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“There in seclusion he should seek delight,<br>
Having left behind sensual pleasures.<br>
Owning nothing, the wise man<br>
Should cleanse himself of mental defilements.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Those whose minds are well developed<br>
In the factors of enlightenment,<br>
Who through nonclinging find delight<br>
In the relinquishment of grasping:<br>
Those luminous ones with taints destroyed<br>
Are fully quenched in the world.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.25"></a></p>
