<h1>77. Good Friend</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing by means of which the unarisen Noble Eightfold Path arises and the arisen Noble Eightfold Path goes to fulfilment by development so effectively as by this: good friendship. When a bhikkhu has a good friend, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And how does a bhikkhu who has a good friend develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.36"></a> Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release…. He develops right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who has a good friend develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.”</p>
