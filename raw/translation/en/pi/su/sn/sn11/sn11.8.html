<h1>8. Verocana, Lord of the Asuras</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī in Jeta’s Grove. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had gone for his day’s abiding and was in seclusion. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, and Verocana, lord of the asuras, approached the Blessed One and stood one at each door post. Then Verocana, lord of the asuras, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “A man should make an effort<br>
Until his goal has been achieved.<br>
Goals shine when achieved:<br>
This is the word of Verocana.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.226"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">Sakka:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “A man should make an effort<br>
Until his goal has been achieved.<br>
Of goals that shine when achieved,<br>
None is found better than patience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">Verocana:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “All beings are bent on a goal<br>
Here or there as fits the case,<br>
But for all creatures association<br>
Is supreme among enjoyments.<br>
Goals shine when achieved:<br>
This is the word of Verocana.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">Sakka:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “All beings are bent upon a goal<br>
Here or there as fits the case,<br>
But for all creatures association<br>
Is supreme among enjoyments.<br>
Of goals that shine when achieved,<br>
None is found better than patience.”</p>
