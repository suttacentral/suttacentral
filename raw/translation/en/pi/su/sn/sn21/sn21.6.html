<h1>6. Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya approached the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, do you see that bhikkhu coming, ugly, unsightly, deformed, despised among the bhikkhus?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“That bhikkhu is of great spiritual power and might. It is not easy to find an attainment which that bhikkhu has not already attained. And he is one who, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>This is what the Blessed One said … <span class="add">who</span> further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Geese, herons, and peacocks,<br>
Elephants, and spotted deer,<br>
All are frightened of the lion<br>
Regardless of their bodies’ size.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“In the same way among human beings<br>
The small one endowed with wisdom—<br>
He is the one that is truly great,<br>
Not the fool with a well-built body.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.280"></a></p>
