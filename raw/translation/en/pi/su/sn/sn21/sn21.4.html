<h1>4. The Newly Ordained Bhikkhu</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Now on that occasion a certain newly ordained bhikkhu, after returning from the alms round, would enter his dwelling after the meal and pass the time living at ease and keeping silent. He did not render service to the bhikkhus at the time of making robes. Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported this matter to him. Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come, bhikkhu, tell that bhikkhu in my name that the Teacher calls him.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Yes, venerable sir,” that bhikkhu replied, and he went to that bhikkhu and told him: “The Teacher calls you, friend.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Yes, friend,” that bhikkhu replied, and he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.278"></a> The Blessed One then said to him: “Is it true, bhikkhu, that after returning from the alms round you enter your dwelling after the meal and pass the time living at ease and keeping silent, and you do not render service to the bhikkhus at the time of making robes?”</p>
<p>“I am doing my own duty, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection in that bhikkhu’s mind, addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, do not find fault with this bhikkhu. This bhikkhu is one who gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant dwelling in this very life. And he is one who, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Not by means of slack endeavour,<br>
Not by means of feeble effort,<br>
Is this Nibbāna to be achieved,<br>
Release from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“This young bhikkhu <span class="add">by my side</span><br>
Is a supreme man indeed:<br>
He carries about his final body,<br>
Having conquered Mara and his mount.”</p>
</blockquote>
