<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Mahakappina approached the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, do you see that bhikkhu coming, fair-skinned, thin, with a prominent nose?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“That bhikkhu is of great spiritual power and might. It is not easy to find an attainment which that bhikkhu has not already attained. And he is one who, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life enters and dwells in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“The khattiya is the best among people<br>
For those whose standard is the clan,<br>
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct<br>
Is best among devas and humans.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“The sun shines by day,<br>
The moon glows at night,<br>
The khattiya shines clad in armour,<br>
The meditative brahmin shines.<br>
But all the time, day and night,<br>
The Buddha shines with glory.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.285"></a></p>
