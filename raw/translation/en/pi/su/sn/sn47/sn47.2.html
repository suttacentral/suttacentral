<h1>2. Mindful</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in Ambapali’s Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir!” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful and clearly comprehending: this is our instruction to you.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu mindful? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is mindful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu exercise clear comprehension? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning; when looking ahead and looking aside; when drawing in and extending the limbs; when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; when eating, drinking, chewing his food, and tasting; when defecating and urinating; when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent. It is in such a way that a bhikkhu exercises clear comprehension.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful and clearly comprehending. This is our instruction to you.”</p>
