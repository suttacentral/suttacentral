<p>Connected Discourses on the Establishments of Mindfulness</p>
<h1>36. Final Knowledge</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four establishments of mindfulness. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“When, bhikkhus, these four establishments of mindfulness have been developed and cultivated, one of two fruits may be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning.”</p>
