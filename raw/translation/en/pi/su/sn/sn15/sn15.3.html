<h1>15.3. Tears</h1>
</div>
<p>At Savatthi. There the Blessed One said: “From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. What do you think, monks: Which is greater, the tears you have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time—crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing—or the water in the four great oceans?”</p>
<p>“As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is the greater: the tears we have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time—crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing—not the water in the four great oceans.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, monks. Excellent. It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.</p>
<p>“This is the greater: the tears you have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time—crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing—not the water in the four great oceans.</p>
<p>“Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a mother. The tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time—crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing—are greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>
<p>“Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a father… the death of a brother… the death of a sister… the death of a son… the death of a daughter… loss with regard to relatives… loss with regard to wealth… loss with regard to disease. The tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time—crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing—are greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>
<p>“Why is that? From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries—enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released.”</p>
