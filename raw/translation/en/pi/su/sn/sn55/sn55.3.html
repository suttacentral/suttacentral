<h1>3. Dīghāvu upāsaka</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw1"></a>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw2"></a>Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw3"></a>Now on that occasion Dīghāvu the lay-disciple was sick afflicted, suffering from a sore disease.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw4"></a>Then Dīghāvu the lay-disciple called to his father Jotika the housefather, saying:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw5"></a>“Come, housefather!</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw6"></a>Do you go to the Exalted One, and on coming to him, with your head worship at the feet of the Exalted One, and say in my name:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw7"></a>‘Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple is sick, afflicted, suffering from a sore disease.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw8"></a>He worships with his head at the Exalted One's feet.’</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw9"></a>Then say:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw10"></a>‘It were a good thing, lord, if the Exalted One would come to the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, out of compassion for him.'”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw11"></a>“Very good, my lad," said Jotika the housefather in reply to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, and went to the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw12"></a>So seated, Jotika the housefather said this to the Exalted One:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw13"></a>“Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple is sick, afflicted, suffering from a sore disease.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw14"></a>He worships with his head at the feet of the Exalted One and says thus:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw15"></a>‘It were a good thing, lord, if the Exalted One would come to the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, out of compassion for him.'”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw16"></a>And the Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw17"></a><a class="pts" id="pts345"></a>Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself, and taking bowl and outer robe set off for the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, and on arriving there sat down on a seat made ready.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw18"></a>Having sat down the Exalted One said this to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw19"></a>“Well, Dīghāvu, I hope you are bearing up, I hope you are enduring.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw20"></a>Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw21"></a>Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw22"></a>“No, lord!</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw23"></a>I am not bearing up.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw24"></a>I am not enduring.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw25"></a>Strong pains come upon me.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw26"></a>They do not abate.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw27"></a>There is no sign of their abating but of their increasing.”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw28"></a>“Then, Dīghāvu, thus must you train yourself:</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw29"></a>‘I will be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw30"></a>He it is the Exalted One, Arahant, a fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and practice, a Happy One, world-knower, unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and mankind, a Buddha, an Exalted One.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw31"></a>I will be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw32"></a>Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, seen in this very life, a thing not involving time, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw33"></a>I will be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw34"></a>Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order, walking uprightly, walking in the right way, walking dutifully is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples: namely, the four pairs of men, the eight sorts of men.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw35"></a>That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw36"></a>Worthy of honour are they, worthy of reverence, worthy of offerings, worthy of salutations with clasped hands,—a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw37"></a>Also I will be blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans, virtues unbroken, whole, unspotted, untarnished, giving freedom, praised by the wise: virtues untainted (by craving or delusion), which lead to concentration of the mind.’</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw38"></a>That, Dīghāvu, is how you must train yourself.”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw39"></a>“As to these four limbs of stream-winning, lord, which have been taught by the Exalted One, all of those conditions are to be found in me, and I do live in accordance with them.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw40"></a>Lord, I am indeed blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw41"></a>He it is the Exalted One, Arahant, a fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and practice, a Happy One, world-knower, unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and mankind, a Buddha, an Exalted One.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw42"></a>I am indeed blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw43"></a>Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, seen in this very life, a thing not involving time, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw44"></a>I am indeed blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw45"></a>Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order, walking uprightly, walking in the right way, walking dutifully is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples: namely, the four pairs of men, the eight sorts of men.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw46"></a>That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw47"></a>Worthy of honour are they, worthy of reverence, worthy of offerings, worthy of salutations with clasped hands,—a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

<p><a class="flw" id="flw48"></a>I am indeed blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans, virtues unbroken, whole, unspotted, untarnished, giving freedom, praised by the wise: virtues untainted (by craving or delusion), which lead to concentration of the mind.”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw49"></a>“Therefore, Dīghāvu, resting on these four limbs of stream-winning, you should further practise the six conditions which are constituent parts of knowledge.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw50"></a>Herein, Dīghāvu, do you dwell contemplating impermanence in all the activities, conscious of ill in impermanence, conscious of there being no self in what is ill, conscious of abandoning, of dispassion, of cessation.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw51"></a>That, Dīghāvu, is how you must train yourself.”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw52"></a>Lord, as to these same six conditions, which are constituent parts of knowledge, all of them are to be found in me.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw53"></a>I do live contemplating impermanence in all the activities, conscious of ill in impermanence, conscious of there being no self in what is ill, conscious of abandoning, of dispassion, of cessation.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw54"></a>Then, lord, I have this thought:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw55"></a>‘I would not have the housefather Jotika here fall into dejection at my death.'”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw56"></a>“Don't you trouble about that, Dīghāvu, my lad! (said his father).</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw57"></a>Look you, Dīghāvu, my lad!</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw58"></a>Attend closely to what the Exalted One is saying to you.”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw59"></a>So the Exalted One, having thus admonished Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, rose from his seat and went away.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw60"></a>And not long after the Exalted One had gone Dīghāvu the lay-disciple made an end.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw61"></a>Thereupon a number of monks went to see the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw62"></a>So seated those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw63"></a>“Lord, that lay-disciple named Dīghāvu, who was admonished in brief by the Exalted One, has made an end.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw64"></a>What is his lot?</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw65"></a>What is his destiny in the life to come?”</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw66"></a>“A sage, monks, was Dīghāvu the lay-disciple.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw67"></a>He lived according to the Norm.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw68"></a>He did not harm me by disputings about the Norm.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw69"></a>Dīghāvu, the lay-disciple, monks, by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort, is reborn by spontaneous birth.</p>
<p><a class="flw" id="flw70"></a>His destiny is not to return from that world.”</p>
