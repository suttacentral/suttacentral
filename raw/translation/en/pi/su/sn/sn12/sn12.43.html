<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthī. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.72"></a> “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the origin and the passing away of suffering. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class="add">comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving. This is the origin of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“In dependence on the ear and sounds … In dependence on the nose and odours … In dependence on the tongue and tastes … In dependence on the body and tactile objects … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class="add">comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving. This is the origin of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the passing away of suffering? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class="add">comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This is the passing away of suffering.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“In dependence on the ear and sounds … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class="add">comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging … cessation of existence … cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.73"></a> sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This is the passing away of suffering.”</p>
