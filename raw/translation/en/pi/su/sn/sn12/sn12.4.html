<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to Vipassī, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble, in that it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering <span class="add">headed by</span> aging-and-death. When now will an escape be discerned from this suffering <span class="add">headed by</span> aging-and-death?’ … [6–9] …</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“‘Cessation, cessation’—thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassī vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.”</p>
