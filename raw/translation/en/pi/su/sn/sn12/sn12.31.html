<h1>31. What Has Come to Be</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthī.… There the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sāriputta thus: “Sāriputta, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’ of the Parayana it is said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>‘Those who have comprehended the Dhamma,<br>
And the manifold trainees here:<br>
Asked about their way of conduct,<br>
Being discreet, tell me, dear sir.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>How should the meaning of this, stated in brief, be understood in detail?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta was silent. A second time and a third time the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sāriputta thus: “Sāriputta, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’ in the Parayana it is said … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.48"></a> How should the meaning of this, stated in brief, be understood in detail?” A second time and a third time the Venerable Sāriputta was silent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Sāriputta, do you see: ‘This has come to be’? Sāriputta, do you see: ‘This has come to be’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Venerable sir, one sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be,’ one is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards what has come to be, for its fading away and cessation. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment, ’ one is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards its origination through nutriment, for its fading away and cessation. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation, ’ one is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards what is subject to cessation, for its fading away and cessation. It is in such a way that one is a trainee.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“And how, venerable sir, has one comprehended the Dhamma? Venerable sir, one sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be,’ through revulsion towards what has come to be, through its fading away and cessation, one is liberated by nonclinging. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment,’ through revulsion towards its origination through nutriment, through its fading away and cessation, one is liberated by nonclinging. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation,’ through revulsion towards what is subject to cessation, through its fading away <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.49"></a> and cessation, one is liberated by nonclinging. It is in such a way that one has comprehended the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Thus, venerable sir, when it is said in ‘The Questions of Ajita’ of the Parayana:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>‘Those who have comprehended the Dhamma,<br>
And the manifold trainees here:<br>
Asked about their way of conduct,<br>
Being discreet, tell me, dear sir.’—</p>
</blockquote>
it is in such a way that I understand in detail the meaning of this that was stated in brief.”
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>“Good, good, Sāriputta!… <span class="add">the Buddha repeats here the entire statement of the Venerable Sāriputta</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.ii.50"></a> … it is in such a way that the meaning of this, stated in brief, should be understood in detail.”</p>
