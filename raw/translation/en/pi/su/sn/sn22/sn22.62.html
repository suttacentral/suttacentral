<h1>62. Pathways of Language</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, there are these three pathways of language, pathways of designation, pathways of description, that are unmixed, that were never mixed, that are not being mixed, that will not be mixed, that are not rejected by wise ascetics and brahmins. What three?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Whatever form, bhikkhus, has passed, ceased, changed: the term, label, and description ‘was’ applies to it, not the term ‘is’ or the term ‘will be.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Whatever feeling … Whatever perception … Whatever volitional formations … <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.72"></a> Whatever consciousness has passed, ceased, changed: the term, label, and description ‘was’ applies to it, not the term ‘is’ or the term ‘will be.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Whatever form, bhikkhus, has not been born, has not become manifest: the term, label, and description ‘will be’ applies to it, not the term ‘is’ or the term ‘was.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Whatever feeling … Whatever perception … Whatever volitional formations … Whatever consciousness has not been born, has not become manifest: the term, label, and description ‘will be’ applies to it, not the term ‘is’ or the term ‘was.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Whatever form, bhikkhus, has been born, has become manifest: the term, label, and description ‘is’ applies to it, not the term ‘was’ or the term ‘will be.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Whatever feeling … Whatever perception … Whatever volitional formations … Whatever consciousness has been born, has become manifest: the term, label, and description ‘is’ applies to it, not the term ‘was’ or the term ‘will be.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the three pathways of language, pathways of designation, pathways of description, that are unmixed, that were never mixed, that are not being mixed, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.73"></a> that will not be mixed, that are not rejected by wise ascetics and brahmins.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“Bhikkhus, even Vassa and Bañña of Ukkala, proponents of noncausality, of the inefficacy of action, and of nihilism, did not think that these three pathways of language, pathways of designation, pathways of description should be criticized or scorned. For what reason? Because they fear blame, attack, and condemnation.”</p>
