<h1>22. The Burden</h1>
</div>
<p>At Savatthi…. There the Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the burden, the carrier of the burden, the taking up of the burden, and the laying down of the burden. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the burden? It should be said: the five aggregates subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. This is called the burden.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the carrier of the burden? It should be said: the person, this venerable one of such a name and clan. This is called the carrier of the burden. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.26"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the taking up of the burden? It is this craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination. This is called the taking up of the burden.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the laying down of the burden? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it. This is called the laying down of the burden.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“The five aggregates are truly burdens,<br>
The burden-carrier is the person.<br>
Taking up the burden is suffering in the world,<br>
Laying the burden down is blissful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Having laid the heavy burden down<br>
Without taking up another burden,<br>
Having drawn out craving with its root,<br>
One is free from hunger, fully quenched.”</p>
</blockquote>
