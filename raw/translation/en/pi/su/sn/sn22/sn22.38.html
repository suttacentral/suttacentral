<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi…. The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Ānanda as he was sitting to one side:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“If, Ānanda, they were to ask you: ‘Friend Ānanda, what are the things of which an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned? What are the things of which an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned? What are the things of which an arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is discerned?’—being asked thus, Ānanda, how would you answer?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Venerable sir, if they were to ask me this, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.39"></a> I would answer thus: ‘Friends, with form that has passed, ceased, changed, an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned. With feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness that has passed, ceased, changed, an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned. It is of these things, friends, that an arising was discerned, that a vanishing was discerned, that an alteration of that which stands was discerned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“‘Friends, with form that has not been born, not become manifest, an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned. With feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness that has not been born, not become manifest, an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned. It is of these things, friends, that an arising will be discerned, that a vanishing will be discerned, that an alteration of that which stands will be discerned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“‘Friends, with form that has been born, that has become manifest, an arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is discerned. With feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness that has been born, that has become manifest, an arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is discerned. It is of these things, friends, that an arising is discerned, that a vanishing is discerned, that an alteration of that which stands is discerned.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Being asked thus, venerable sir, I would answer in such a way.”</p>
<p>“Good, good, Ānanda!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><span class="add">The Buddha here repeats the entire answer of the Venerable Ānanda, concluding:</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.40"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Being asked thus, Ānanda, you should answer in such a way.”</p>
