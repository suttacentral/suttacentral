<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, form is suffering, both of the past and the future, not to speak of the present. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iii.20"></a> Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple is indifferent towards form of the past; he does not seek delight in form of the future; and he is practising for revulsion towards form of the present, for its fading away and cessation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Feeling is suffering … Perception is suffering … Volitional formations are suffering … Consciousness is suffering, both of the past and the future, not to speak of the present. Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple is indifferent towards consciousness of the past; he does not seek delight in consciousness of the future; and he is practising for revulsion towards consciousness of the present, for its fading away and cessation.”</p>
