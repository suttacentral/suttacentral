<h1>10. Vajira</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> At Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Vajira dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Savatthi for alms. When she had walked for alms in Savatthi <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.135"></a> and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding. Having plunged into the Blind Men’s Grove, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then Mara the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhuni Vajira, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “By whom has this being been created?<br>
Where is the maker of the being?<br>
Where has the being arisen?<br>
Where does the being cease?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then it occurred to the bhikkhuni Vajira: “Now who is this that recited the verse—a human being or a nonhuman being?” Then it occurred to her: “This is Mara the Evil One, who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in me, desiring to make me fall away from concentration.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>Then the bhikkhuni Vajira, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “Why now do you assume ‘a being’?<br>
Mara, is that your speculative view?<br>
This is a heap of sheer formations:<br>
Here no being is found.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a> “Just as, with an assemblage of parts,<br>
The word ‘chariot’ is used,<br>
So, when the aggregates exist,<br>
There is the convention ‘a being.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> “It’s only suffering that comes to be,<br>
Suffering that stands and falls away.<br>
Nothing but suffering comes to be,<br>
Nothing but suffering ceases.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhuni Vajira knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.</p>
