<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> While dwelling at Uruvela. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open air in the thick darkness of the night while it was drizzling. Then Mara the Evil One, wishing to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the Blessed One, approached the Blessed One and, not far from him, displayed diverse lustrous shapes, both beautiful and hideous. Then the Blessed One, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” addressed him in verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “You’ve wandered on through the long course<br>
Creating beautiful and hideous shapes.<br>
Enough, Evil One, with that trick of yours:<br>
You’re defeated, End-maker!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “Those who are well restrained<br>
In body, speech, and mind,<br>
Do not come under Mara’s control<br>
Nor become Mara’s henchmen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.105"></a></p>
