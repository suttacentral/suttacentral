<h1>7. Sleep</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then, when the night was fading, the Blessed One, having spent much of the night walking back and forth in the open, washed his feet, entered his dwelling, and lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture, with one leg overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, having attended to the idea of rising.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “What, you sleep? Why do you sleep?<br>
What’s this, you sleep like a wretch?<br>
Thinking ‘The hut’s empty’ you sleep:<br>
What’s this, you sleep when the sun has risen?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “Within him craving no longer lurks,<br>
Entangling and binding, to lead him anywhere;<br>
With the destruction of all acquisitions<br>
The Awakened One sleeps:<br>
Why should this concern you, Mara?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
