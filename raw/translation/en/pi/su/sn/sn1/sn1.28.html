<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> “Those of great wealth and property,<br>
Even khattiyas who rule the country,<br>
Look at each other with greedy eyes,<br>
Insatiable in sensual pleasures.<br>
72 Among these who have become so avid,<br>
Flowing along in the stream of existence,<br>
Who here have abandoned craving?<br>
Who in the world are no longer avid?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “Having left their homes and gone forth,<br>
Having left their dear sons and cattle,<br>
Having left behind lust and hatred,<br>
Having expunged ignorance—<br>
The arahants with taints destroyed<br>
Are those in the world no longer avid.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.16"></a></p>
