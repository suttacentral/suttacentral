<h1>5. How Many Must One Cut?</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Standing to one side, that devatā recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “How many must one cut, how many abandon,<br>
And how many further must one develop?<br>
When a bhikkhu has surmounted how many ties<br>
Is he called a crosser of the flood?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="add">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “One must cut off five, abandon five,<br>
And must develop a further five.<br>
A bhikkhu who has surmounted five ties<br>
Is called a crosser of the flood.”</p>
</blockquote>
