<h1>32. Stinginess</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of devatās belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’ s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Then one devatā, standing to one side, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “Through stinginess and negligence<br>
A gift is not given.<br>
One who knows, desiring merit,<br>
Should surely give a gift.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>Then another devatā recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “That which the miser fears when he does not give<br>
Is the very danger that comes to the nongiver.<br>
The hunger and thirst that the miser fears<br>
Afflict that fool in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a> “Therefore, having removed stinginess,<br>
The conqueror of the stain should give a gift.<br>
Deeds of merit are the support for living beings<br><span class="add">When they arise</span> in the other world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Then another devatā recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a> “They do not die among the dead<br>
Who, like fellow travellers on the road,<br>
Provide though they have but a little:<br>
This is an ancient principle.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a> “Some provide from the little they have,<br>
Others who are affluent don’t like to give.<br>
An offering given from what little one has<br>
Is worth a thousand times its value.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.19"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>Then another devatā recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a> “The bad do not emulate the good,<br>
Who give what is hard to give<br>
And do deeds hard to do:<br>
The Dhamma of the good is hard to follow.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a> “Therefore their destination after death<br>
Differs for the good and the bad:<br>
The bad go to hell,<br>
The good are bound for heaven.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a>Then another devatā said to the Blessed One: “Which one, Blessed One, has spoken well?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a>“You have all spoken well in a way. But listen to me too:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a> “If one practises the Dhamma<br>
Though getting on by gleaning,<br>
If while one supports one’s wife<br>
One gives from the little one has,<br>
Then a hundred thousand offerings<br>
Of those who sacrifice a thousand<br>
Are not worth even a fraction<br><span class="add">Of the gift</span> of one like him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a>Then another devatā addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a> “Why does their sacrifice, vast and grand,<br>
Not share the value of the righteous one’s gift?<br>
Why are a hundred thousand offerings<br>
Of those who sacrifice a thousand<br>
Not worth even a fraction<br><span class="add">Of the gift</span> of one like him?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a>Then the Blessed One answered that devatā in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a> “Since they give while settled in unrighteousness,<br>
Having slain and killed, causing sorrow,<br>
Their offering—tearful, fraught with violence—<br>
Shares not the value of the righteous one’s gift.<br>
That is why a hundred thousand offerings<br>
Of those who sacrifice a thousand<br>
Are not worth even a fraction<br><span class="add">Of the gift</span> of one like him.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.20"></a></p>
</blockquote>
