<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then, when the night had advanced, Kokanada, Pajjunna’s daughter, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Great Wood, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, she paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “I worship the Buddha, the best of beings,<br>
Dwelling in the woods at Vesali. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.30"></a><br>
Kokanada am I,<br>
Kokanada, Pajjunna’s daughter.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “Earlier I had only heard that the Dhamma<br>
Has been realized by the One with Vision;<br>
But now I know it as a witness<br>
While the Sage, the Fortunate One, teaches.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “Those ignorant people who go about<br>
Criticizing the noble Dhamma<br>
Pass on to the terrible Roruva hell<br>
And experience suffering for a long time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> “But those who have peace and acquiescence<br>
In regard to the noble Dhamma,<br>
On discarding the human body,<br>
Will fill the host of devas.”</p>
