<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a> “If a bhikkhu is an arahant,<br>
Consummate, with taints destroyed,<br>
One who bears his final body,<br>
Would he still say, ‘I speak’?<br>
And would he say, ‘They speak to me’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> “If a bhikkhu is an arahant,<br>
Consummate, with taints destroyed,<br>
One who bears his final body,<br>
He might still say, ‘I speak,’<br>
And he might say, ‘They speak to me.’<br>
Skilful, knowing the world’s parlance,<br>
He uses such terms as mere expressions.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a> “When a bhikkhu is an arahant,<br>
Consummate, with taints destroyed,<br>
One who bears his final body,<br>
Is it because he has come upon conceit<br>
That he would say, ‘I speak,’<br>
That he would say, ‘They speak to me’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a> “No knots exist for one with conceit abandoned;<br>
For him all knots of conceit are consumed.<br>
Though the wise one has transcended the conceived, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.15"></a><br>
He still might say, ‘I speak,’<br>
He might say too, ‘They speak to me.’<br>
Skilful, knowing the world’s parlance,<br>
He uses such terms as mere expressions.”</p>
