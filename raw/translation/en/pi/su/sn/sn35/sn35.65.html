<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then the Venerable</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Samiddhi approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Mara, Mara.’ In what way, venerable sir, might there be Mara or the description of Mara?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.39"></a> eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Mara exists or the description of Mara.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“Where there is the ear … the mind, where there are mental phenomena, mind-consciousness, things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Mara exists or the description of Mara.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Where there is no eye, Samiddhi, no forms, no eye-consciousness, no things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Mara does not exist nor any description of Mara.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“Where there is no ear … no mind, no mental phenomena, no mind-consciousness, no things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Mara does not exist nor any description of Mara.”</p>
