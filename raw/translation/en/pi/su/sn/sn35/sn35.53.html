<h1>53. Abandoning Ignorance</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>At Savatthi. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.31"></a> and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see, for ignorance to be abandoned and true knowledge to arise?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhu, when one knows and sees the eye as impermanent, ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge arises. When one knows and sees forms as impermanent … When one knows and sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-norpleasant—ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge arises. When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhu, ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge arises.”</p>
