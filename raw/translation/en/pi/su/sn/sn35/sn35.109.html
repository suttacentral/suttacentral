<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the things that fetter and the fetter. Listen to that…</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that fetter, and what is the fetter? The eye, bhikkhus, is a thing that fetters; the desire and lust for it is the fetter there. The ear is a thing that fetters … The mind is a thing that fetters; the desire and lust for it is the fetter there. These are called the things that fetter, and this the fetter.”</p>
