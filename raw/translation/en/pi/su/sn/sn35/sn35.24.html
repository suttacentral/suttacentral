<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all? The eye is to be abandoned, forms are to be abandoned, eye-consciousness is to be abandoned, eye-contact is to be abandoned, <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.16"></a> and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“The ear is to be abandoned … The mind is to be abandoned, mental phenomena are to be abandoned, mind-consciousness is to be abandoned, mind-contact is to be abandoned, and whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all.”</p>
