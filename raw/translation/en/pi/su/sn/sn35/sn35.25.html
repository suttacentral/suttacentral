<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for abandoning all through direct knowledge and full understanding. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all through direct knowledge and full understanding? The eye is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full understanding, forms are to be so abandoned, eye-consciousness is to be so abandoned, eye-contact is to be so abandoned, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full understanding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“The ear is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full understanding … The mind is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full understanding, mental phenomena <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.17"></a> are to be so abandoned, mind-consciousness is to be so abandoned, mind-contact is to be so abandoned, and whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned through direct knowledge and full understanding.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all through direct knowledge and full understanding.”</p>
