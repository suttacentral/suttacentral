<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then the Venerable Bahiya approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“What do you think, Bahiya, is the eye permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable sir.” … <span class="add">as in §32 down to:</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.iv.64"></a> … “He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>

He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.” And the Venerable Bahiya became one of the arahants.</p>
