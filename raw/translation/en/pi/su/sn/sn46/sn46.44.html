<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘an unwise dolt, an unwise dolt.’ In what way, venerable sir, is one called ‘an unwise dolt’?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Bhikkhus, it is because one has not developed and cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment that one is called ‘an unwise dolt.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.100"></a> What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity. It is because one has not developed and cultivated these seven factors of enlightenment that one is called ‘an unwise dolt.’”</p>
