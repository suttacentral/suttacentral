<h1>28. Partaking of Penetration</h1>

With a mind that has developed the enlightenment factor of equanimity, he penetrates and sunders the mass of greed … the mass of hatred … the mass of delusion that he has never before penetrated and sundered.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“It is, Udayī, when the seven factors of enlightenment are developed and cultivated in this way that they lead to penetration.”</p>
