<p>Connected Discourses on the Factors of Enlightenment</p>
<h1>14. Ill (1)</h1>

<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahakassapa was dwelling in the Pipphali Cave—sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahakassapa. He sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Mahakassapa:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>“I hope you are bearing up, Kassapa, I hope you are getting better. I hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be discerned.” <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.v.80"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“Venerable sir, I am not bearing up, I am not getting better. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be discerned.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>“These seven factors of enlightenment, Kassapa, have been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness has been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna…. The enlightenment factor of equanimity has been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. These seven factors of enlightenment, Kassapa, have been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Surely, Blessed One, they are factors of enlightenment! Surely, Fortunate One, they are factors of enlightenment!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, the Venerable Mahakassapa delighted in the Blessed One’s statement. And the Venerable Mahakassapa recovered from that illness. In such a way the Venerable Mahakassapa was cured of his illness.</p>
