<p>Kindred Sayings on the Limbs of Wisdom</p>

<h1>104. Bearded Wheat</h1>
</div>
<h2>i. Seclusion</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Suppose monks, the spike of bearded wheat or bearded barley be well aimed.</p>
<p>When pressed by hand or foot, it is possible that it will pierce hand or foot and draw blood.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, the spike is well aimed.</p>
<p>Even so, monks, owing to the right aim of way-culture it is possible that a monk will pierce ignorance, will draw knowledge, will realize Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, his view is well aimed.</p>
<p>And how, monks, does a monk by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture so pierce ignorance, draw knowledge and realize Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture pierces ignorance, draws knowledge and realizes Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</h2>
<p>“Suppose monks, the spike of bearded wheat or bearded barley be well aimed.</p>
<p>When pressed by hand or foot, it is possible that it will pierce hand or foot and draw blood.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, the spike is well aimed.</p>
<p>Even so, monks, owing to the right aim of way-culture it is possible that a monk will pierce ignorance, will draw knowledge, will realize Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, his view is well aimed.</p>
<p>And how, monks, does a monk by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture so pierce ignorance, draw knowledge and realize Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture pierces ignorance, draws knowledge and realizes Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>iii. Ending in the Deathless</h2>
<p>“Suppose monks, the spike of bearded wheat or bearded barley be well aimed.</p>
<p>When pressed by hand or foot, it is possible that it will pierce hand or foot and draw blood.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, the spike is well aimed.</p>
<p>Even so, monks, owing to the right aim of way-culture it is possible that a monk will pierce ignorance, will draw knowledge, will realize Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, his view is well aimed.</p>
<p>And how, monks, does a monk by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture so pierce ignorance, draw knowledge and realize Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture pierces ignorance, draws knowledge and realizes Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>iv. Ending in Nibbāna</h2>
<p>“Suppose monks, the spike of bearded wheat or bearded barley be well aimed.</p>
<p>When pressed by hand or foot, it is possible that it will pierce hand or foot and draw blood.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, the spike is well aimed.</p>
<p>Even so, monks, owing to the right aim of way-culture it is possible that a monk will pierce ignorance, will draw knowledge, will realize Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, his view is well aimed.</p>
<p>And how, monks, does a monk by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture so pierce ignorance, draw knowledge and realize Nibbāna?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>That is how a monk, by view well aimed, by well aimed way-culture pierces ignorance, draws knowledge and realizes Nibbāna.</p>
