<h1>17.1. Of an Arahant having Accumulating Merit</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc312"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is accumulation of merit in the case of an Arahant.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If the Arahant have accumulation of merit, you must allow he may also have accumulation of demerit… . And <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.1.2"></a> you must equally allow that he achieves meritorious karma, and karma leading to the imperturbable, that he does actions conducing to this or that destiny, or plane of rebirth, actions conducing to authority, influence, riches, adherents and retainers, celestial or human prosperity… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.1.3"></a>You must further admit that, in his karma, he is heaping up or unloading, putting away or grasping, scattering or binding, dispersing or collecting. If he does none of these things, but having unloaded, put away, scattered, dispersed, so abides, your proposition is untenable.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.1.4"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But may not an Arahant give gifts—clothing, alms, food, lodging, medicaments for sickness, food, drink? May he not salute shrines, hang garlands on them, and perfumes and unguents? May he not make consummate oblations before them? You admit this. But these are all merit-accumulating acts… .</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
