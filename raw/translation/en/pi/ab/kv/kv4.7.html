<h1>4.7. Of becoming “The Enlightened” (Buddha) through Enlightenment (bodhi).</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc166"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one who is gifted with the Marks is a Bodhisatta</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> By your proposition you must also admit <span class="add">a fortiori</span> (a) that anyone who is gifted with the Marks to a limited extent, with one-third, or one-half of them, is a limited, one-third, or half Bodhisatta, respectively—which you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.2"></a>And (b) that a universal emperor—who is also gifted with the Marks—is a Bodhisatta, and that the previous study and conduct, declaring and teaching the Dhamma in the Bodhisatta’s career, are the same as those in the universal emperor’s career; that (c) when a universal emperor is born, devas receive him first, and then humans, as they do the new-born Bodhisatta; <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.3"></a> that (d) four sons of the devas receiving the new-born imperial babe place it before the mother, saying: <span class="sutta_ll">“Rejoice, O queen! to thee is born a mighty son!”</span> even as they do for the new-born Bodhisatta; that (e) two rain-showers, cold and warm, come from the sky, wherewith both babe and mother may be washed, even as happens at the birth of a Bodhisatta; <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.4"></a> that (f) a new-born imperial babe, standing on even feet, and facing north, walks seven paces, a white canopy being held over him, and looking round on all sides speaks the trumpet notes: <span class="sutta_ll">“I am the foremost, I am chief, I am the highest in the world. This is my last birth; now is there no more coming again to be!”</span> <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.5"></a> that (g) there is manifested at<a class="pc" id="pc153"></a> the birth of the one as of the other a mighty light, a mighty radiance, a mighty earthquake; that (h) the natural body of the one as of the other lights up a fathom’s space around it; that (i) one and the other see a great dream—all of which you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.6"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span>  But if you reject my proposition, tell me: is there not a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, to one encloived with the thirty-two marks of a Superman, two careers lie open, and none other. If he live the life of the house, he becomes Lord of the Wheel, a righteous Lord of the Right, Ruler of the four quarters, conqueror, guardian of the people’s good, owner of the Seven Treasures; his do those seven treasures become, to wit, the Wheel treasure, the Elephant, the Horse, the Jewel, the Woman, the Steward, the Heir Apparent. More than a thousand sons are his, heroes, vigorous of frame, crushers of the hosts of the enemy. He, when he has conquered this earth to its ocean bounds, is established not by the scourge, not by the sword, but by righteousness. But if he go forth from his home to the homeless, he becomes an Arahant Buddha Supreme, rolling back the veil from the world.”</span></p>
<p>Is not therefore my proposition true?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
