<h1>13.4. Of One whose Salvation is Morally Certain (Niyata)</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc275"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one who is morally certain of salvation has entered the Path of Assurance.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc276"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that the so-called “Assured “enters upon the True Path of Assurance when assured of immediate retribution, and upon the False Path of Assurance when assured of final salvation? That having first practised the Path, he afterwards enters upon the Assurance;  that having first practised the Stream-Winner’s Path, he afterwards enters upon the Assurance of the, Stream-Winner, and so on… That finally, entrant upon Assurance comes after practise of the applications in mindfulness and the rest of the Factors of Enlightenment?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.4.2"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas:</span> But in contradicting us, you imply that the Bodhisatta was not fitted by that last birth to penetrate the, Truths.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, I say not so.</p>
<p><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas:</span> Then he was <span class="add">already</span> assured of entering upon the Path of Assurance.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
