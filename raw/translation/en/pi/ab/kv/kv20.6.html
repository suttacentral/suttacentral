<h1>20.6. Of Insight</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc349"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That insight into the twelve-fold base is spiritual.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you mean that there are twelve kinds of insight? You deny. I ask again. You admit. Then are there twelve <span class="add">First or</span> Stream-winning Paths? or Fruits thereof? Or twelve of any of the other Paths or Fruits?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.6.2"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“(A.i.) That this Ariyan Truth concerning Suffering, O <i>bhikkhus</i>, was not among the doctrines handed down, but there arose in me the vision, there arose in me the insight (<i>ñāṇa</i>), there arose in me the wisdom, there arose in me the understanding, there arose in me the light; (ii.) that this Ariyan fact of Suffering must be comprehended; (iii.) that it was comprehended; (B.i.) that this was the Ariyan Truth concerning the Cause of Suffering; (ii.) that the Cause of Suffering was to be put away. (iii.) was put away; (C.i.) that this was the Ariyan Truth concerning the Cessation of Suffering; (ii.) that this Cessation was to be realized; (iii.) had been realized; (D.i.) that this was the Ariyan Truth concerning <a class="pc" id="pc350"></a> the Path going to the Cessation of Suffering; (ii.) that that Path was to be developed; (iii.) that it had been developed.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the insight based on these twelve parts is spiritual.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
