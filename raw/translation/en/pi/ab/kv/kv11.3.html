<h1>11.3. Of Insight and Ordinary Consciousness</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc256"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That insight (<i>ñāṇa</i>) is not conjoined with consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But are you prepared to identify insight, with all that is admittedly detached from consciousness: with matter, <i>Nibbāna</i>, or the organs and objects of sense? Scarcely!… </p>
<p>Or are you prepared to declare “insight” as having nothing in common with understanding? For you will admit that understanding, as controlling power or force, as supremely right view, as intuitive search for truth, is not detached from, but is bound up with, consciousness?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.3.2"></a>Insight, again, as we agree, includes, involves the activity of the aggregate of the coefficients of consciousness, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.3.3"></a> as also does understanding. Both of these are conjoined with consciousness. How then can insight be detached from it? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.3.4"></a> Hence, if you maintain that insight and understanding, both involving conscious coefficients, are respectively detached from and conjoined with consciousness,<a class="pc" id="pc257"></a> you are committed to this: that the aggregate of coefficients is in part conjoined with, in part detached from, consciousness—which you of course deny… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.3.5"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> You contend then that an Arahant who is enjoying cognitions by way of sight, etc., may be said to “have insight”?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But is his insight conjoined with that consciousness (sight, etc.)?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said… . </p>
<p><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> Then my proposition holds.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But such an argument holds equally for “understanding,” if you substitute that for “insight.” And you have admitted the connection between understanding and consciousness.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
