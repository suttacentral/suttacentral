<h1>13.8. Of Lust for the Unpleasant</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc279"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is such a thing as lusting for what is disagreeable.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you go so far as to maintain that of the beings who delight in the painful, some wish for it, long for it, seek, search, hunt for it, and persist in cleaving to it? Is not rather the opposite your genuine belief? You assent. Then how do you maintain your proposition?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.8.2"></a>Can anyone have at once a latent bias of lust for painful feeling and a latent bias of aversion from pleasant feeling? Will not these two forms of bias be <span class="add">really</span> directed inversely, the former craving pleasure, the latter hating pain?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.8.3"></a><span class="add">Uttarãpathakas:</span> But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“He, thus, expert in complacency and antipathy, delights in and commends whatsoever feeling he feels, pleasant, painful, or neutral, and persists in cleaving to it.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely there is such a thing as lusting for the unpleasant?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
