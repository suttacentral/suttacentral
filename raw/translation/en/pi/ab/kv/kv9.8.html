<h1>9.8. Of Sound as purely Mental</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc239"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That sound is nothing more than a diffusion of initial and sustained mental application.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc240"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.8.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If this be true, you must affirm no less that sounds from mental contact are solely an irradiation of mental contact; that such as are from feeling are solely an irradiation of feeling. So also for such as are from perception, volition, thought in general, mindfulness, understanding. This you will not do.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.8.2"></a>Must you not also affirm of a sound that is an irradiation of mental application, that it is <span class="add">none the less</span> to be cognized by hearing, impinges on the ear, comes into the auditory avenue? This you deny; you affirm that such a sound is not cognizable by hearing, etc. How then can you speak of it <em>as sound</em>?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
