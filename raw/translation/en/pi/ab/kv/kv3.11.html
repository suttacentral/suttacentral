<h1>3.11. Of Unconscious Life</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc153"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there is consciousness among the denizens of the sphere called Unconscious.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc154"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you surely cannot admit that such a being has conscious life or destiny, dwells among conscious beings, fares onward with conscious continuity from birth to birth, has consciousness as his birthright, has acquired a conscious personality? Is not the opposite of all these terms true of him? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.2"></a> Is their life, etc., fivefold in its constituents? Is it not rather a life, destiny… acquisition of personality, of a single constituent? Hence, even if we grant your proposition, you cannot say that such a being, when consciously functioning, functions by just that <span class="add">act of</span> consciousness you ascribe to him; nor do you claim this.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.3"></a>If, in <span class="cr">Kv3.11.1</span>, you substitute for “unconscious beings” “men,” you could and would describe the latter further as “having conscious life, and destiny, and so on.” And you would describe them, further, as having a life, destiny, habitation, further rebirth, constitution, acquisition of personality <span class="add">as determined for them</span> by five organic constituents. But when I say you have committed yourself to all this with respect to unconscious beings, in virtue of your proposition, you deny. Similarly for <span class="cr">Kv3.11.3</span>, if we substitute “man” for “such a being.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.4"></a>Let us assume the truth of your proposition, admitting, of course, that there is consciousness in the human sphere—why do you go on to affirm, for those devas, an unconscious life, destiny, habitation, further rebirth, constitution, acquisition of personality, but deny it for men? And why do you go on, further, to affirm a life, destiny, etc., of one organic constituent for those devas, but deny it for men? Why, finally, do you deny, for the unconscious beings, the functioning in consciousness by just that <span class="add">quota of</span> consciousness you assign to them, but affirm it in the case of human beings?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.5"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> If it is wrong to say “there is consciousness in<a class="pc" id="pc155"></a> the Unconscious devas,” let me remind you of a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“There are devas, <i>bhikkhus</i>, called the Unconscious Beings; now those devas, when consciousness does arise, decease from that group.</span></p>
<p>But our view really is this, that <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.6"></a> they are only conscious sometimes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> That is to say, they are sometimes conscious beings, having conscious life, having fivefold organic life, and sometimes unconscious beings, having unconscious life, having a single organic life—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.11.7"></a>Again, at what time are they conscious, at what time not?</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> At decease and at rebirth, but not during life.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But then the same absurd transformation must happen.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
