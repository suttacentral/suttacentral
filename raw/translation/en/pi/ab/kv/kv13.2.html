<h1>13.2. Of a Doomed Man’s Morality</h1>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc273"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a person doomed for a aeon may not acquire moral consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yet you admit that he may make gifts <span class="add">to the Saṅgha</span>—how then can your proposition hold? And not only gifts—namely, of raiment, alms, food, lodging, medicaments against illness, various kinds of food, drink—but also that he may render homage at a shrine of older faiths, decorate it with a wreath, with incense, with ointment, salute it by marching round… . </p>

Now you admit that he may acquire good consciousness arising out of that <span class="add">purgatorial discipline</span>.

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
