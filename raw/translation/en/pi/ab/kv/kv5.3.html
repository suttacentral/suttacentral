<h1>5.3. Of Perverted Perception or Hallucination (in <i>jhāna</i>)</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc175"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That in one who has attained <i>jhāna</i> through the earth-artifice, etc., knowledge <span class="add">of what is seen</span> is perverted.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc176"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If your proposition is right, then do you imply that this “perversion” is the same as that involved in seeing the permanent in the impermanent, happiness in Suffering, a soul in what is not soul, the beautiful in the ugly? Of course you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.2"></a>Again, you imply that such a person’s knowledge during <i>jhāna</i> is not proficient. But you do not wish to imply this, but the opposite.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.3"></a>You admit that the reversal of judgment which sees permanence in impermanence is a bad judgment, and those other judgments above-stated also. Yet you will not admit that cognition during <i>jhāna</i> is badly accomplished.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.4"></a>You hold on the contrary that it is well accomplished. Yet a similar perversion in the case of those other four judgments you consider bad.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.5"></a>If it were an Arahant who so accomplished <i>jhāna</i>, would you claim a perverted cognition for him? You could not. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.6"></a> Or, if you could, you would have to make him liable to reversals of perception, consciousness, and views in general.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.7"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> But if my proposition is wrong, do you hold that, when any one attains <i>jhāna</i> by earth-cognition, everything becomes earth to him? No, you reply. Then surely his judgment is upset.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc177"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.3.8"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you will admit that the earth is there, and that the subject enters <i>jhāna</i> by regarding earth as earth? Where then is the perversion of cognition?</p>
<p>You say that the earth is actually there, and that in entering <i>jhāna</i> by the consciousness of earth as earth, perception is perverted. Substitute for earth <i>Nibbāna</i>: would you still say that perception was perverted?… </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
