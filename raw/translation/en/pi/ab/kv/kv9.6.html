<h1>9.6. Of Past and Future Mental Objects</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc237"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That consciousness of a past object is without object.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you admit that there is such a thing as a mental object that is past? Then how can you make such a self-contradictory statement? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.2"></a> Again, is there not adverting of mind, ideation, co-ordinated application, attention, volition, anticipation, aim, concerning that which is past?… </p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc237"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a consciousness, having an idea that is future, is without object.</p>
<p><span class="add"><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.4"></a> <em>are verbatim as in</em> <span class="cr">Kv9.6.1</span> and <span class="cr">Kv9.6.2</span> “future” <em>substituted for</em> “past”. Note by Sujato: In the original English translation, these were in a separate section, Kv.9.7. This appears to be a mistake, and I have followed the Mahāsaṅgīti edition in combining these. This means that all subsequent sections in this vagga are numbered one less than the original.</span></p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc238"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.5"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin continues:</span>  You admit of course concerning what is present, that there can be adverting of mind, ideation, and so on (<span class="cr">Kv9.6.1</span>), so that consciousness of a present idea has its mental object. And you admit that there can be adverting of mind and the rest about the past and also about the future. Yet in both these cases mind, you say, is without mental object. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.6"></a> Why not also say then that, while there can be adverting of mind, etc., about the present, mind occupied about a present object is mind without object?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.6.7"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But you admit that a “past object” does not exist <span class="add">at the present moment</span>? Surely then a mind occupied with past object is occupied with no (that is, with a non-existent) object… .</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
