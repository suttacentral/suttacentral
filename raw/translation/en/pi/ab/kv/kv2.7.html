<h1>2.7. Of the Duration of Consciousness</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc124"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a single <span class="add">unit of</span> consciousness lasts for a day.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If your proposition is true, does one-half of the day belong to the “nascent moment,” and one-half to the<a class="pc" id="pc125"></a> “cessant moment”? You say no; but you have implied it. A similar admission is involved in affirming that a state of consciousness lasts two days, or four days or eight, ten, or twenty days, or a month, or two, four, eight, or ten months, or a year, or any number of years, or any number of æons.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.2"></a>Are there other phenomena beside mind which arise and cease many times during one day? Yes, you say? Then do you contend that they come and go as quickly as mind? If you say no, then your proposition falls. If you say they do, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“I consider, <i>bhikkhus</i>, that there is no phenomenon that comes and goes so quickly as mind. It is not easy to find a simile to show how quickly mind comes and goes.”</span></p>
<p>Again: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Just as a monkey faring through the dense forest catches one bough, and, letting it go, catches another, and then another, even so, <i>bhikkhus</i>, with what is called thought, or mind, or consciousness, by day as by night, one arises when another perishes.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.4"></a><span class="add">Take the content of a state of consciousness: </span> does any visual consciousness or other sense-consciousness last a whole day, or any bad thought, such as consciousness accompanied by passion, hate, ignorance, conceit, error, doubt, sloth, distraction, impudence, or indiscretion? If not, then neither can consciousness be said to last a day.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.5"></a>Does one hear, smell, taste, touch, apprehend mentally by means of the same <span class="add">unit of</span> consciousness as one sees? Or see, hear, etc., or touch by means of the same <span class="add">unit of</span> consciousness as one apprehends mentally? You<a class="pc" id="pc126"></a>say “no.” Then you cannot affirm that one <span class="add">and the same unit of</span> consciousness lasts a whole day.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.6"></a>Similarly, if you deny that one moves backward with the same <span class="add">unit of</span> consciousness as one moves forward, and <em>vice versâ</em>, you cannot affirm your proposition. A similar argument applies to looking backward, looking forward, and to bending, extending by means of the same unit of consciousness.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.7"></a>In the case of the devas who have reached the realm of space-infinity, does any unit of consciousness last their whole lifetime? You affirm it does, yet you deny a similar duration in the case of humanity. You deny it also in the case of all devas of the plane of sense-desires, and of all devas of the higher or Rūpa plane, why not of those of the first-named non-Rūpa plane?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.8"></a>You affirm, I say, this duration of a unit of consciousness during the 20,000 æons of the Arūpa-deva’s life, yet you deny an analogous duration in a unit of human consciousness, lasting, say, for 100 years, and you deny it in the case of all those devas of the Kāmaloka and Rūpaloka, whose lifetime varies from 500 years in the Four Great Kings to 16,000 æons of years in the senior devas.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.9"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> Does then the mind of the devas who have reached the plane of space-infinity arise and cease moment by moment?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> It does.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc127"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> But do these devas themselves decease, and are they reborn moment by moment?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> Surely this momentary living and dying is involved in the momentary happening of consciousness?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.7.10"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But if you affirm that in the case of these devas a unit of consciousness lasts as long as they live, then you must also admit that they die with the same unit of consciousness as that wherewith they are reborn;  but you are not prepared to admit this… </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
