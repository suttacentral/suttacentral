<h1>4.10. Of Putting off the Fetters</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc172"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the putting off of all the Fetters is Arahantship.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.10.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> By your proposition you must admit that all the Fetters are put off by the Path of Arahantship (the Fourth)—which is not correct, you allow. The proximate candidate for the Fruit of that Path is not occupied in again getting rid of the theory of individuality, doubt, or the infection of mere rule and ritual, already rejected in the First Path. Nor <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.10.2"></a> in getting rid of the grosser sensuality and enmity conquered already in the Second Path; nor <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.10.3"></a> of the residual sensuality put away without remainder in the Third Path. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.10.4"></a> Was not his work pronounced by the Exalted One to be the putting off without remainder of lust for corporeal, and for incorporeal rebirth, conceit, distraction and ignorance?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.10.5"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> But if my proposition is wrong, do you not nevertheless admit that for an Arahant all Fetters are put off? Surely then I may say that Arahantship is a putting off all the Fetters?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
