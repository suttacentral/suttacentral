<h1>10.10. Are Acts of Intimation Virtue?</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc251"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That acts of intimation are moral acts.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.10.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But the conduct called moral—abstaining from taking life, from stealing, from fornication, lying, and strong drink—do you affirm that these are so many modes of intimation? You do not… . </p>
<p><span class="add">Acts intimating minor courtesies such as</span> salutation, rising to welcome, presenting clasped hands, acts of propriety, offering a seat, a couch, water for the feet, a towel for the feet, rubbing the back in the bath—are these morality? Yes, you say. But you would not affirm they<a class="pc" id="pc252"></a> are the five abstinences just named. Those are moral—are these?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs10.10.2"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas and Sammitīyas:</span> But if acts of intimation are not moral, are they immoral? If not, then they are moral.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
