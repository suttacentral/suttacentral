<h1>4.6. Of becoming “The Enlightened” (Buddha) through Enlightenment (Bodhi).</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc164"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That through Enlightenment on becomes “The Enlightened.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If it is in virtue of “enlightenment” that one becomes “The Enlightened,” then it follows that, in virtue of the cessation, suspension, subsidence of enlightenment, he ceases to be The Enlightened—this you deny, but you imply it.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.2"></a>Or is one The Enlightened only in virtue of past enlightenment? Of course you deny this—<span class="add">then my previous point holds</span>. If you assent, do you mean that one who is The Enlightened exercises the work of enlightenment by that past enlightenment only? If you assent, you imply that he understands Suffering, puts away its cause, realizes its cessation, develops the Eightfold Path thereto, by that past enlightenment—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc165"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.3"></a> Substitute for “past,” “future” enlightenment, and the same argument applies.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.4"></a>Let us assume that one is called The Enlightened through present enlightenment: if you assert that he exercises the work of enlightenment through present enlightenment, you must also affirm <span class="add">by analogy</span> that if he is called The Enlightened through past, or <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.5"></a> through future enlightenment, it is by that that he understands Suffering, puts away its cause, and so on—which you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.6"></a>For if an enlightened person, so-called in virtue of past, or <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.7"></a> of future enlightenment, does not exercise the work of enlightenment, through one or the other respectively, then <span class="add">by analogy</span> one who is enlightened by present enlightenment does not exercise enlightenment through that present enlightenment—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.8"></a>Do you then affirm that one is called The Enlightened through past, present, and future enlightenment? Then are there three enlightenments? If you deny, your affirmation <span class="add">by the foregoing</span> cannot stand. If you assent, you imply that he, being continually, constantly, uninterruptedly gifted with and intent through three enlightenments, these three are simultaneously present to him—which you of course deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.9"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But surely one who is called The Enlightened, is one who has acquired enlightenment? How is my proposition wrong?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.6.10"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You assume that one is called The Enlightened from having acquired enlightenment, or by enlightenment—is enlightenment the same as the acquiring of enlightenment? </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
