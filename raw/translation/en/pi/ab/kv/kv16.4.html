<h1>16.4. Of Attending to All at Once</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc305"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one can attend to everything simultaneously.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc306"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.4.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that we know the consciousness by which we so attend? You deny. But I ask you again—now you assent. Then do we know as consciousness the consciousness by which we so attend? You deny. But I ask you again—now you assent. Then is the subject of consciousness its own object? You deny. But I ask you again—now you assent. Then do we experience mental reaction by the same mental reaction? Do we feel a feeling by that feeling? And so on for perception, volition, cognition, applied thought, sustained thought, zest, mindfulness, understanding? If you deny, you undo your previous affirmations… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.4.2"></a>When we attend to the past as past, do we then attend to the future as future? You deny. But I ask you again—now you assent. But this commits you to a collocation of two parallel mental processes… . And this holds if I substitute “present” for “future.’… And if you claim that we can, while attending to the past as past, attend also to the future as such, and to the present as such, we get a collocation of three parallel mental processes… . And—<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.4.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.4.4"></a> <span class="add">we may ring the changes with</span> the same argument on other permutations of the time relations… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.4.5"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“‘All conditions are impermanent.’<br>
When one sees this with wisdom,<br>
Then one is disgusted with suffering:<br>
This is the Path of Purity.</p>
<p>“‘All conditions are suffering.’<br>
When one sees this with wisdom,<br>
Then one is disgusted with suffering:<br>
This is the Path of Purity.</p>
<p>“‘All <i>dhammas</i> are not-self.’<br>
When one sees this with wisdom,<br>
Then one is disgusted with suffering:<br>
This is the Path of Purity.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence we can attend to all at once.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
