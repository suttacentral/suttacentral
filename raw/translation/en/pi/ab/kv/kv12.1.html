<h1>12.1. Of Self Restraint.</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc264"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That self-restraint is <span class="add">positive</span> action (karma).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If this be so, you imply that ocular self-restraint is moral action of the eye; so for the other senses—you cannot admit this… . But as to self-restraint, involved in sense-control of body and in control of mind, you at first deny it to be moral action, and then<a class="pc" id="pc265"></a> assent to the proposition that it is moral action. Why then do you not concede this for the remaining four senses? That which you admit as true for mind, the co-ordinator of sense, you must admit as true no less for the five senses.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.1.2"></a>Want of self-restraint you admit of course is <span class="add">immoral</span> action (karma): is it eye-karma when self-restraint is not practised by the controlling power of sight?… <span class="add">proceed as in <span class="cr">Kv12.1.1</span>:</span> .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.1.3"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Here, <i>bhikkhus</i>, a <i>bhikkhu</i>, when he sees an object with the eye, grasps at the general characters thereof, … ”</span></p>
<p><span class="add">And again:</span></p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“… does not grasp at the external appearance, … when he hears a sound, … cognizes a thing with the mind, … does not grasp, etc.”</span></p>
<p>Surely both self-restraint and want of it are herein shown to be morally effective action?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
