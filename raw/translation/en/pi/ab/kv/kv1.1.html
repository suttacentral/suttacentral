</div>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc8"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the “person” is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact.</p>
<h2>The Eight Refutations</h2>
<h3>The First Refutation</h3>
<h4>The Fivefold Affirmative Presentation</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is “the person” known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc9"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known <em>in the same way</em> as a real and ultimate fact is known?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Acknowledge your refutation: (i) If the person be known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you should also say, the person is known in the same way as <span class="add">any other</span> real and ultimate fact <span class="add">is known</span>.</p>
<p>(ii) That which you say here is wrong, namely, (1) that we ought to say, “the person is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact,” but (2) we ought not to say, the person is known in the same way as <span class="add">any other</span> real and ultimate fact <span class="add">is known</span>.</p>
<p>(Suffering) If the latter statement (2) cannot be admitted, then indeed the former statement (1) should not be admitted.</p>
<p>(iv) In affirming the former statement (1), while (v) denying the latter (2), you are wrong.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Rejoinder</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.2"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is the “person” not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, it is not known.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is it unknown in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is <span class="add">known</span>?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Acknowledge the rejoinder: (i) If the person be not<a class="pc" id="pc10"></a> known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you should also say: not known in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is known.</p>
<p>(ii) That which you say here is wrong, namely, that (1) we ought to say “the person is not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact,” and (2) we ought not to say: “not known in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is known.”</p>
<p>If the latter statement (2) cannot be admitted, then indeed the former statement (1) should not be admitted either.</p>
<p>In affirming (2), while denying (1), you are wrong.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Refutation</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.3"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin (continues):</span> But if you imagine we ought to affirm that (1) the person is not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, but we ought not also to affirm that (2) the “person” is not known in the same way as <span class="add">any</span> real and ultimate fact <span class="add">is known</span>, then you, who have actually assented to the very proposition contained in that negative question, must certainly be refuted in the following manner: let us then refute you, for you are well refuted!</p>
<p>(i) If (1) the “person” is not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you should have said <span class="add">as well</span> that (2) the “person” is not known in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is known.</p>
<p>(ii) What you affirm is false, namely, that the former statement (1) should be affirmed, but that the latter (2) should not be affirmed.</p>
<p>If the latter statement (2) is not to be affirmed, then neither truly can the former (1) be affirmed.</p>
<p>That which you say here—(1) should be affirmed, but not (2); this statement of yours is wrong.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Application</h4>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc11"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.4"></a> <span class="add">Puggalavādin (continues):</span> If this be a faulty refutation, look at the parallel procedure in your own argument (<span class="cr">Kv1.1.1</span>). Thus, according to us (1) was true (the person is known, etc.); but (2) was not true (… known in the same way, etc.). Now we, who admitted these propositions, do not consider ourselves to have been refuted. <span class="add">You say</span> you have refuted us; anyway we are not well refuted. Your argument ran that if we affirmed (1), we must also affirm (2); that if we did not admit the truth of (2), neither could we admit the truth of (1); that we were wrong in assenting to (1), while denying (2).</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Conclusion</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.5"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin (continues):</span> No (I repeat), we are not to be refuted thus, (i) namely, that my proposition compels me to assent to your “known in the same way,” etc.; (ii) your pronouncement that my proposition (1) coupled with my rejection (2) is wrong; (Suffering) that if I reject (2), I must also reject (1); (iv) that I must affirm both or none. This refutation of yours is badly done. I maintain, on the other hand, that my rejoinder was well done, and that my sequel to the argument was well done.</p>
<h3>The Second Refutation</h3>
<h4>The Fivefold Adverse Controversy</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.6"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is the person not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, it is not known … <span class="add"><em>continue as in <span class="cr">Kv1.1.1</span>, reversing the speakers, and substituting</em> “not known” <em>for</em> “known”:</span> </p>
<h4>The Fourfold Rejoinder</h4>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc12"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.7"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes … <span class="add"><em>continue as in <span class="cr">Kv1.1.2</span>, reversing the speakers, and substituting</em> “known” <em>for</em> “not known.”:</span> </p>

<h4>The Fourfold Refutation</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.8"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But if you imagine we ought to affirm that “the person” is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, but that we ought not to affirm as well that the person is known in the same way as <span class="add">any other</span> real and ultimate fact <span class="add">is known</span>, etc … <span class="add"><em>continue as in <span class="cr">Kv1.1.3</span>, reversing the speakers, and substituting</em> “known” <em>for</em> “not known”:</span> .</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Application</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.9"></a><span class="add">Theravādin (continues):</span> If this be a faulty refutation, look at the parallel procedure in your own argument (<span class="cr">Kv1.1.6</span>). Thus, according to us (a) was true (a person is not known, etc.); but (b) was not true (… not known in the same way, etc.). Now we, who admitted these propositions, do not consider ourselves to have been refuted, etc.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Conclusion</h4>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.10"></a><span class="add">Theravādin (continues):</span> No, I repeat, we are not to be refuted as you claim to have refuted us … wherefore your refutation was suffering done, etc.</p>
<h3>The Third Refutation</h3>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.11"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc13"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> It is.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known <em>everywhere</em> in that sense?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Acknowledge the refutation: If the person be known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you ought to admit that the person is known in that sense everywhere. You are wrong to admit the one proposition (A) and deny the other (C). If (C) is false, (A) is also false.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Refutation.</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.12"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> It is.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known always in that sense?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … <span class="add"><em>continue as above, substituting</em> “always” <em>for</em> “everywhere”:</span> .</p>
<h3>The Fifth Refutation</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.13"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known … <span class="add"><em>as in <span class="cr">Kv1.1.11</span></em>:</span>  … <em>in everything</em> in the sense of a real and ultimate fact? <span class="add"><em>continue as in <span class="cr">Kv1.1.11</span>, substituting</em> “in everything” <em>for</em> “everywhere “:</span> .</p>
<h3>The Sixth Refutation</h3>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc14"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.14"></a> <span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is the person <em>not</em> known … <span class="add"><em>otherwise as in</em> <span class="cr">Kv1.1.11</span>:</span>  … everywhere in that sense? … <span class="add"><em>substituting</em> “not known” <em>for</em> “known”:</span> .</p>
<h3>The Seventh Refutation</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.15"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is the person <em>not</em> known … always in that sense? … 
</p>
<h3>The Eighth Refutation</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.16"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is the person not known … in everything in that sense? … 
</p>
<h2>Comparative Inquiry</h2>
<h3>Comparison with other Realities, simply treated.</h3>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.17"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, and is material quality also known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is material quality one thing and the person another?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said.</p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Acknowledge the refutation: If the person and material quality be each known in the sense of real and ultimate facts, then indeed, good sir, you should also have admitted that they are distinct things. You are wrong to <a class="pc" id="pc15"></a> admit the former proposition and not the latter. If the latter cannot be admitted, neither should the former be affirmed. To say that the person and material quality are both known in the sense of real and ultimate facts, but that they are not mutually distinct things, is false.</p>

<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Apart from the conditioned or the unconditioned, is there another, a third alternative?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> I repeat my question.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> <a class="pc" id="pc55"></a>Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“There are, <i>bhikkhus</i>, these two irreducible categories—what are the two? The irreducible category of the conditioned, the irreducible category of the unconditioned. These are the two.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Hence it is surely wrong to say that apart from the conditioned and the unconditioned, there is another, a third alternative.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.226"></a><span class="add">Theravādin (continues):</span> You say that the person is neither conditioned nor unconditioned? Are then the conditioned, the unconditioned, the person, entirely different things?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Are the aggregates conditioned, <i>Nibbāna</i> unconditioned, the person neither conditioned nor unconditioned?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then are the aggregates, <i>Nibbāna</i>, and the person, three entirely different things?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add"><em>The last two questions are then applied to each aggregate taken separately: </em>—material qualities, feeling, perception, mental co-efficients, consciousness:</span> .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.227"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the genesis of the person apparent, and its passing away also, and is its duration distinctively apparent?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <span class="add">Then</span> is the person conditioned?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> It was said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, there are these three characteristics of the conditioned: of conditioned things the genesis is apparent, the passing away is apparent, the duration amidst change is apparent.</span>” </p>
<p>Hence if these three are characteristics of the person, this is also<a class="pc" id="pc56"></a> conditioned. Are these three characteristics not apparent in the person?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, they are not apparent.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then is the person unconditioned?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> It was said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, there are these three characteristics of the unconditioned: of unconditioned things, <i>bhikkhus</i>, the genesis is not apparent, the passing away is not apparent, the duration amidst change is not apparent.”</span> </p>
<p>Now if all these <span class="add">as you say</span> do not characterize the <span class="add">notion of</span> “person”, the person is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.228"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> The person who has attained final <i>Nibbāna</i>, does he exist in the Goal, or does he not exist therein?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> He exists in the Goal.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is then the person who has finally attained eternal?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person who has attained final <i>Nibbāna</i> and does not exist in the Goal annihilated?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.228a"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> On what does the person depend in order to persist?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> He persists through dependence on coming-to-be.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is <span class="add">the state of</span> coming-to-be impermanent, conditioned, arisen through a cause, liable to perish, to pass away, to become passionless, to cease, to change?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc57"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person also impermanent, conditioned, arisen through a cause, liable to perish, to pass away, to become passionless, to cease, to change?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.229"></a><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is it wrong to say “the person is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact”?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Is there no one who, on feeling pleasurable feeling, knows that he is feeling it?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Surely, if that be so, good sir, it is right to say “the person is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact” … and if he, on feeling painful feeling, knows that he is feeling it—you admit this?—it is right to say “the person is known,” etc. So also for neutral feeling.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.230"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> I note what you affirm. Now is it <em>for this reason</em> that you maintain the person to be known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then is one who, on feeling pleasurable feeling, knows he is feeling it, a personal entity, and is one who, on that occasion, does not know, <em>not</em> a personal entity?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You deny this also in the case of painful and neutral feeling?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes, that cannot truly be said, … </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you maintain, <em>because of this self-awareness</em>, that the person is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is then pleasurable feeling one thing and the self-conscious enjoyer another?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said … </p>
<p><span class="add"><em>Same query and answer in the case of painful and neutral feelings.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p> … or in contemplating <span class="add">the concept of</span> feeling, or consciousness, or certain mental properties with respect to these in himself, respectively?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Then surely, good sir, it is right to say as I do with respect to the person.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.232"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Granting the carrying out by anyone of the four applications in mindfulness, is it <em>for this reason</em> that you say as you do with respect to the personal entity?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then is anyone when so engaged a person, and not, when he is not so engaged?</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.1.234"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>

<p>Is it thus in the Suttanta?</p>
<p><span class="add">Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
