<p><a class="pc" id="pc189"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the sphere of infinite space is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.4.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Are you implying that it is in this respect identical with <i>Nibbāna</i>, the Shelter, the Cave, the Refuge,<a class="pc" id="pc190"></a> the Beyond, the Undying, the Deathless? Yon deny… Then you cannot so class it. If you affirm, we may then have two Unconditioneds, two <i>Nibbāna</i>s… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.4.2"></a>You admit, do you not, that the sphere of infinite space is a form of rebirth, a destination, an abode of beings, a sequel in living, a matrix of birth, a station for reborn consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Then is the unconditioned to be so described? Of course not… .</p>
<p>Is there karma which brings us to rebirth in that sphere? “Yes,” you say. Then is there karma which brings about rebirth in the unconditioned? Of course you deny… . There are beings who for their deserts are reborn in that sphere of infinite space, but are there any who for their deserts are reborn in the unconditioned? Of course you deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.4.3"></a>Do any beings become born, decay, die, decease, and spring up again in that sphere? Yes? But surely not in the unconditioned… .</p>
<p>Does mind in its four constituents exist in that sphere? Yes? But hardly in the unconditioned… . You cannot call the latter a plane of life with four constituents, as is the former.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.4.4"></a><span class="add">Opponent:</span>  But did not the Exalted One say that the four Immaterial spheres are imperturbable? Surely then we may call them unconditioned.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
