<h1>20.3. Of the Guards of Purgatory</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc345"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That in the purgatories there are no guards.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that there are no punishments Inflicted in the purgatories? You maintain the contrary? But you cannot maintain both propositions.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc346"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.3.2"></a> You admit that on earth there are both punishments and executioners? Yet you deny that the latter exist in purgatory… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.3.3"></a>Moreover, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p> “Not Vessabhu nor yet the Petas’ King,<br>
Soma, Yama, or King Vessavaṇa—<br>
The deeds that were his own do punish him<br>
Who goes from here to other worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence there are guards in purgatory.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.3.4"></a>Again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Him, <i>bhikkhus</i>, hell’s guards torture with the fivefold punishment; they thrust a hot iron stake through one hand, then another through the other hand, then one through the foot, then another through the other foot; they thrust a hot iron stake through the middle of the chest. And he thereupon feels painful, piercing, intolerable suffering, nor does he die till that evil deed of his is cancelled.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.3.5"></a>Again, was it not said <span class="add">further</span> by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Him, <i>bhikkhus</i>. Hell’s guards make to lie down and flay him with hatchets… they place him head downwards and flay him with knives… they bind him to a chariot and drive him to and fro over burning, blazing, glowing ground… they lift him up on to a great hill of burning, blazing, white-hot coals and roll him down the fiery slope… they double him up and cast him into a hot brazen jar, burning, blazing, glowing, where he boils, coining up like a bubble of foam, then sinking, going now to this side, now to that. There he suffers fierce and bitter pain, nor does he die till that evil karma is cancelled. Him, <i>bhikkhus</i>, they cast into the Great Purgatory. Now this: </span>
<a class="pc" id="pc347"></a>	
</p><div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>
In districts measured out four-square, four-doored,<br>
Iron the ramparts hounding it, with iron roofed,<br>
Iron its soil welded by fiery heat,<br>
Spreading a hundred leagues it stands for ages.”</p>

</div>
<p>Hence there surely are guards in purgatory.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
