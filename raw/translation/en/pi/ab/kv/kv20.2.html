<p><a class="pc" id="pc344"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That “insight” is not for the average man.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc345"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.2.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you imply that a worldly man has no analytic discernment, no analytic understanding, no ability to investigate or examine, no faculty of research, no ability to mark well, observe closely, mark repeatedly. Is not the opposite true?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.2.2"></a>Again, you admit, do you not? that there is not one of the four <i>Rūpajhānas</i> or of the four <i>Arūpajhanas</i> to which a man of the world may not attain, and that he is capable of liberality towards the Brethren as to the four requisites: clothes and so forth.

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
