<h1>17.2. Of Arahants and Untimely Death</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc313"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That an Arahant cannot have an untimely death.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then are there no murderers of Arahants? You admit there are. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.2.2"></a> Now when anyone takes the life of an Arahant, does he take away the remainder of life from a living man, or from one who is not living? If the former, then you cannot maintain your proposition. If the latter, there is no murder, and your admission is wrong.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.2.3"></a>Again, you admit that poison, weapons, or fire may get access to the body of an Arahant. It is therefore clear that an Arahant may suffer sudden death.<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.2.4"></a> But if you deny, then there can be no murderer.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.2.5"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas and Siddhatthikas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“I declare, <i>bhikkhus</i>, that there cannot be destruction <span class="add">of karmic energy</span> ere the outcome of deeds that have been deliberately tor ought and conserved has been experienced, whether that destruction be under present conditions, or in the next or in a subsequent series of conditions.”</span></p>
<p>Hence there is no untimely dying for an Arahant.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
