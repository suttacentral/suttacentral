<h1>20.5. Of the Ariyan Path</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc347"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Path is fivefold <span class="add">only</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc348"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.5.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was not the Path pronounced by the Exalted One to be eightfold—namely, right views, right purpose, right speech, action, and livelihood, right effort, mindfulness, and <i>samādhi</i>? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.5.2"></a> And did he not also say:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Of all the means the Eightfold Path is best,<br>
And best of all true things the Stages Four;<br>
Best state of mind disinterestedness, <br>
And of all bipeds best the man-who-sees.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Surely, then, the Path is eightfold.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.5.3"></a>But you tell me that though these three—right speech, right action, right livelihood—are factors of the Path, nevertheless they are not path, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.5.4"></a> while the other five are both factors of the Path and Path. Why this distinction?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.5.5"></a><span class="add">Mahīsāsakas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“For him who has hitherto been quite pure in karma of deed and of word and of livelihood, this Ariyan Eightfold Path will go to perfection of development.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the Path is fivefold.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs20.5.6"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“In whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold Path is not found, neither in it is there found a saintly man of the first, or of the second, or of the third, or of the fourth degree. And in whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold Path is found, in it is such a saintly man found. Now in this doctrine and discipline, Subhadda,<a class="pc" id="pc349"></a> is found the Ariyan Eightfold Path, and in it, too, are found men of saintliness of all four degrees. Void are the systems of other teachers, void of saintly men.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the Path is eightfold.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
