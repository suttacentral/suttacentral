<h1>1.6. Of Everything as persistently existing</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc84"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That everything exists.</p>
<h2>1.6.1.  To Purge <span class="add">Abstract Time-</span>Ideas</h2>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc85"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You say that “all exists”. Hereby you are involved in these further admissions: </p>
<p>All exists everywhere, at all times, in every way, in all things, not in a combined state, the non-existent exists, the right view which looks upon your wrong view as wrong exists.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.2"></a>Again, taking all in terms of time, you affirm that the past exists, the future exists, the present exists. But is not the past <span class="add">something that has</span> ceased—that is, departed, changed, gone away, gone utterly away? How then can you say “the past exists”? Again, is not the future <span class="add">something that is</span> not yet born, not yet come to be, not yet come to pass, has not happened, not befallen, is not manifested? How then can you say “the future exists”?</p>
<p>The present, you say, exists; and the present is <span class="add">something that has as yet</span> not ceased, not departed, not changed, not gone away, not utterly gone away. And the past, you say, “exists”; then you should say of the past also that it has not ceased, not departed, and so on.</p>
	
<p>Again, the present, you say, exists—that is, it is born,<a class="pc" id="pc86"></a> has become, has come to pass, happened, befallen, is manifested. And the future, you say, “exists”; then you should say of the future also that it is born, has become, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, the past, you say, exists, and yet that it has ceased, departed, and so on. And the present, you say, exists; then you should say of the present also that it has ceased, departed, and so on.</p>
<p>Once more, the future, you say, exists, and yet that it is not born, not become, and so on. And the present, you say, exists; then you should say of the present also that it is not born, not become, and so on.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.3"></a>Do past material qualities exist? “Yes,” you say. But if you describe these in terms of what “has ceased,” and so on, as aforesaid, how can you say “those past qualities exist”? Similarly, for future material qualities—if they <span class="add">in common with all that is future</span> are not born, and so on, how can they be said to exist?</p>
<p><span class="add">Similarly, the other more general admissions afore-stated apply also to material qualities in particular: </span> if in saying “present material qualities exist,” you mean they have “not ceased to be,” etc., then if past material qualities “exist,” they also have “not ceased to be,” etc. And if, in saying present material qualities “exist,” you mean they are “born, are come to be,” etc., then, if future material qualities “exist,” they also are “born, are come to be,” etc. Again, if in saying “past material qualities exist,” you mean that they have “ceased, departed,” etc., then, if present material qualities “exist” they also have “ceased,” etc.</p>
<p>And if, in saying “future material qualities exist,” you mean they are “not yet born,” etc., then, if present material qualities “exist,” they also are “not yet born,” etc.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.4"></a>And all these arguments apply equally to each of the other four aggregates—to feeling, to perception, to mental coefficients, to consciousness.</p>
<p>For instance, if, in saying, “present consciousness exists,” you mean it has not ceased to be, not departed, etc., then,<a class="pc" id="pc87"></a> if past consciousness <span class="add">still</span>“exists” it also has not “ceased to be, departed,” etc. And if, in saying “present consciousness exists” you mean it is born, is come to be, etc., then, if future consciousness, as you say, “exists” it also “is born, is come to be,” etc. Again, if, in saying “past consciousness exists,” you mean it has ceased, departed, etc., then, if present consciousness, as you say, “exists,” it also has ceased, departed,” etc. And if, in saying “future consciousness exists,” you mean it is not yet born, has not come to be, etc., then, when you say “present consciousness exists” it also is not yet born, has not come to be” etc.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.5"></a>In the expression “present material-aggregate,” in whichever order you use the two terms, if no distinction is made between each, if they are used as identical, of one import, as the same, as of the same content and origin, then when you say, that (A) present material-aggregate, on ceasing, gives up its present state, you must also admit that (A1) material-aggregate gives up its materiality. Similarly, when you say, that (a) present material-aggregate on ceasing does not give up its materiality, you must also admit that (a1) it does not give up its presence (present state).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.6"></a><span class="add">Sarvāstivādin:</span> But in the expression “white cloth,” in whichever order you use the terms, if no distinction is made between each, if they are used as identical, of one import, as the same, as one in content and origin, then when you say (A) “white cloth when it is being dyed loses its whiteness” you must also admit (A1) it loses its “clothness.”</p>
<p>Again, in the expression “white cloth” in whichever order you use the terms, if no distinction is made between each, if they are used as aforesaid, then when you say (a) “white cloth when it is being dyed does not give up its clothness” you must also admit that (a1) it does not give up its whiteness. … </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.7"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If you assert that the material-aggregate retains its materiality, you must admit that the<a class="pc" id="pc88"></a> material-aggregate is permanent, persistent, eternal, not subject to change. You know that the opposite is true; hence it should not be said that materiality is retained.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.8"></a><i>Nibbāna</i> does not abandon its state as <i>Nibbāna</i>—by this we mean <i>Nibbāna</i> is permanent, persistent, eternal, not subject to change. And you ought to mean this, too, in the case of material-aggregate, if you say that the latter does not abandon its materiality.</p>
<p>Do you mean by “material-aggregate does not abandon its materiality,” that the aggregate is impermanent, non-persistent, temporary, subject to change? You assent. Well, then, you should affirm the same with regard to <i>Nibbāna</i> when you say: <i>Nibbāna</i> does not abandon its state as <i>Nibbāna</i>. … </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.9"></a>If, in your statement “the past exists” (<span class="cr">Kv1.6.2</span>), you mean it retains its pastness or preterition, then in your statement “the future exists” (<span class="cr">Kv1.6.2</span>) you ought to mean: it retains its futurity, and in your statement “the present exists,” you ought to mean: it retains its presentness, or presence. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.10"></a> Each of these affirmations involves a similar affirmation respecting the other two divisions of time.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.11"></a>If the past “exists” and retains its preterition, then must it be permanent, persistent, eternal, not subject to change; and this, you admit, is not right. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.12"></a> When you say <i>Nibbāna</i> exists, and retains its state as <i>Nibbāna</i>, you mean: it is permanent and so on. So much also must you mean if you predicate the same respecting “the past.” Or, if you do not mean that the past is permanent and so on, when you say “it exists and retains its pretention,” then when you say this of <i>Nibbāna</i>, you imply that <i>Nibbāna</i> is impermanent and so on.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.13"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.20"></a>All the foregoing <span class="cr">Kv1.6.9-Kv.1.6.12</span>) applies equally to the particular past, future, and present things called “the five aggregates’—e.g: </p>
<p>If, in your statement “past consciousness exists,” you mean: it retains its preterition, then, in your statement “future consciousness exists,” you must mean: such consciousness retains its futurity; also, in your statement” present consciousness exists,” you must mean such consciousness<a class="pc" id="pc89"></a> retains its presence. And each of these affirmations involves a similar affirmation respecting the other two divisions of time. Again, if past consciousness exists and retains its pretention, then must it be permanent, persistent, eternal, not subject to change—and this you admit is not right. When you say, “<i>Nibbāna</i> exists and retains its state as <i>Nibbāna</i>,” you mean it is permanent and so on. So much also must you mean, if you predicate the same respecting past consciousness. Or, if you do not mean that past consciousness is permanent and so on, when you say “it exists and retains its pretention,” then when you say this of <i>Nibbāna</i>, you imply that <i>Nibbāna</i> is impermanent, not persistent, temporary, subject to change. … </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.21"></a>Is the past a non-existent thing? If you say “yes,” you must reject your view that the past exists. If you say “the non-past exists,” then to say “there exists a past,” is equally wrong.</p>
<p>Again, is the future a non-existent thing? If you say “yes,” you must reject your view that the future exists. If you say “the non-future <span class="add">alone</span> exists,” then to say “there exists the future,” is equally wrong.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.22"></a>Does that which has been future become present? If you assent, you must admit that that which was future is <em>the same</em> as that which is now present. You admit this? Then you must admit that anything which having been <span class="add">future</span>, is <span class="add">present</span>, will in turn, having been <span class="add">future</span>, become once more <span class="add">present</span>. You admit this? Then you must also admit that that which, not having been <span class="add">future</span>, is not <span class="add">present</span>, will not in turn have been <span class="add">future</span> only to become <span class="add">present</span> again.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc90"></a><span class="add">This series of dilemmas is also applicable to “present” and “past,” thus: </span> Does that which has been present become past? If <em>so, you</em> must admit that that which was present is <em>the same</em> as that which is past. If you do admit this, you must also admit that anything which having been <span class="add">present</span>, is <span class="add">past</span> will in turn have been <span class="add">present</span> only to become <span class="add"><em>past once more</em></span> If you do admit this, you must also admit it as true for their contradictories.</p>
<p>Similarly for future, present, past: Does the future, having been, become present, and the present, having been, become past? <em>If so</em>, you must admit that these three are identical, and that the process of becoming the one after having been the other is repeated. If you do admit this, you must admit it as true for their contradictories.</p>
	
<h2>1.6.3.  Applications Of The Purged Time-Ideas</h2>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.23"></a>Do <span class="add">all the conditions of an act of visual perception: </span> eye, visible objects, visual consciousness, light, attention, when <em>past</em>, exist? If you say “yes,” you should also admit that one sees the object that is past with an eye that is past. Similarly, for all the conditions of all other varieties of sense-perception that are past—to wit: ear, audible objects, auditory consciousness, space, attention;  the nose, odours, olfactory consciousness, air, attention; the tongue, sapid objects, sapid consciousness, liquid, attention; body, touches, body-consciousness, extensity, attention; mind, objects of consciousness, reflection, the seat <span class="add">of mental activity</span>, attention. For instance, taking the last: you should then also admit that one perceives the “past” object of consciousness with the “past” mind.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc91"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.24"></a> Similarly, if the conditions of a future act of sense-perception exist—e.g., eye, visible objects, visual consciousness, light, attention—then one should see future object with future eye, and so on. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.25"></a> For if you say that the conditions of present visual and other perception exist, and that you see present objects with an eye, etc., that is present, so, if you maintain that the past conditions of sense-perception “exist,” must you say that with the past eye one sees past objects, etc.; <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.26"></a> and similarly for future conditions of sense-perception.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.27"></a>If you deny that with the past eye, visible objects, visual consciousness <em>existing</em>, one does not see past objects with past eyes, equally must you deny that, with the conditions for present vision existing, one does not see present objects with present eyes. Similarly for the other senses.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.28"></a>Similarly for future vision.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.29"></a>Does past coming-to-know exist? If you assent, you must admit that the function of knowing is done by that same <span class="add">past</span> coming-to-know. And if you admit that, you must also admit that by that same <span class="add">past</span> coming-to-know one understands Suffering, puts away its cause, realizes its cessation, practises the Path <span class="add">not by present cognition</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.30"></a>The same argument applies to future coming-to-know.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.31"></a>Does present coming-to-know, or cognition, exist, and is the function of knowing performed by that same present cognition? If you assent, you must admit that, past coming-to-know <em>also existing</em> <span class="add"><span class="cr">Kv1.6.29</span></span>, the function of knowing is performed by <em>that</em> same past cognition. So that if, by that present cognition, the nature of Suffering be understood, its cause put away, its cessation realized, the path leading thereto be practised, it is no less by that past cognition that all this is effected. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.32"></a> The same reasoning precisely holds good to the extent to which you maintain that present coming-to-know exists. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.33"></a> But you maintain that,<a class="pc" id="pc92"></a> whereas the past process-of-knowing exists, it is impossible to perform the function of knowing with it. Then, by parity of reasoning, surely it is equally impossible to know with the <em>existing</em> present process-of-knowing. More particularly, if you cannot carry out the Four Truths concerning Suffering <span class="cr">Kv1.6.29</span>, <span class="cr">Kv1.6.31</span> with past <em>existing</em> cognition, neither can you do so with present <em>existing</em> cognition—which is absurd. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.34"></a> Future knowing and present knowing are mutually involved in just the same way.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.35"></a>Do the corruptions of <span class="add">his</span> past exist for the Arahant? You reply “yes.” But is the Arahant <span class="add">now</span> lustful with <span class="add">that past, yet existing</span> lust, hostile with that hate, ignorant with that delusion, vain with that conceit, errant with that error, perplexed with that doubt, torpid with that sloth, distracted with that excitement, shameless with that impudence, reckless with that indiscretion, all of which are past and yet “existing”?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.36"></a>Similarly, you say that the past <span class="add">five lower</span> fetters and corruptions exist for the Never-Returner. But is he now holding that theory of soul, perplexed with that doubt, infected by that misapprehension of behaviour and vows, subject to residual sensuous passions and ill-will, that are past and yet “existing”?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.37"></a>Similarly, you say that the same past fetters, and grosser sensuous passions and coarser forms of ill-will “exist” for the Once-Returner. But is he now bound by those fetters, and subject to those grosser passions and coarse forms of ill-will?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.38"></a>Similarly, you say that the past three fetters and lust, hate and delusion entailing the rebirths of misery, exist for the Stream-Winner. But is he now bound by those fetters and those vices?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.39"></a>Granting that past lust exists for an average man, is he affected by that same lust? Yes? Then, surely, if past lust “exists” for an Arahant, he also is affected by that same lust? Similarly for the other nine corruptions<a class="pc" id="pc93"></a> <span class="add"><span class="cr">Kv1.6.35</span></span>. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.40"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.42"></a> If you say that the average man is still ubject to corruptions or fetters, past, yet “existing,” you must also admit that past corruptions and fetters, in so far as they “exist” in those who have reached any stage of the path, involve their being subject to them at present. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.43"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.46"></a> Conversely, if it is impossible for an Arahant, or one in any lower stage of the path, to be now subject to certain corruptions or to fetters which “exist” for him <em>as past</em>, it is equally impossible for the average man to be subject to a corruption or fetter which “exists” for him as “past.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.47"></a>Do past hands exist? Then must you also admit that taking and laying down by them is also apparent <span class="add">as existences</span>. Similarly for legs, feet, and their going to and fro, for joints of limbs, and their contracting and extending, for the stomach, and its hunger and thirst.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.48"></a>Does the past body exist? Then must you also admit that the past body undergoes lifting and lowering, annihilation and dissolution, the being shared by crows, vultures, and kites; also that poison weapons, fire may get access to the body;  also that this past body may be liable to be bound by confinement by rope or chain, by village, town, or city jail, by fourfold restraint, and by the fifth, to wit, strangling.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.49"></a>Do the <span class="add">other</span> past elements <span class="add">of the past body</span> exist—its cohesiveness, heat, mobility? If you assent, then you mast admit that with each past element the past body still performs the corresponding function.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.50"></a>Do past and future as well as present material aggregates exist? If so, then there must be three material aggregates. And if you say that past and future as well as present fivefold aggregates exist, you must admit that there are fifteen aggregates. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.51"></a> Similarly, you must admit three organs of sight, or thrice twelve organs and objects<a class="pc" id="pc94"></a> of sense. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.52"></a> Similarly, you must admit three elements of sight, or eighteen elements multiplied by three time-divisions, fifty-four in all. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.53"></a> Similarly, you must admit three visual controllers,or sixty-six controllers in all.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.54"></a>Would you say that a Wheel-turning monarch of the past or of the future, as well as one of the present, “exists”? But this amounts to saying that three Wheel-turning monarchs are actually living. The same implication lies in a similar assertion respecting Perfectly Enlightened Ones <span class="add">Buddhas</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.55"></a>Does the past exist? “Yes” you reply. Then, is the existent the past? You reply “the existent may be past, and may be not-past.” But herein you make out that the past may be the past and may be the not-past. Your position is wrong, and you are refuted.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.56"></a>You are similarly involved if you say that, whereas the future exists, the existent may be future <span class="add">and</span> may not be future. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.57"></a> So also for “the present.” <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.58"></a> Similarly, if you affirm that <i>Nibbāna</i> exists, but that the existent may be <i>Nibbāna</i>, may not be <i>Nibbāna</i>: this amounts to saying that <i>Nibbāna</i> <span class="add">is or may be</span> not <i>Nibbāna</i>, not-<i>Nibbāna</i> <span class="add">is, or may be</span> <i>Nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc95"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.59"></a> <span class="add">Sarvāstivādin:</span> Is it wrong to say “the past exists,” “the future exists”?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Sarvāstivādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Whatsoever material quality, <i>bhikkhus</i>, whether past, future or present, is either internal or external, gross or subtle, common or excellent, distant or near, is called the material aggregate. Whatsoever feeling, whether past, future, or present, or which the foregoing may be said, is termed the aggregate of feeling. So also are the other three aggregates.”</span> </p>
<p>Surely then the past exists, the future exists.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.60"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<div class="sutta_ll">
<p>“These three modes in word, term, or name, <i>bhikkhus</i>, which have been distinct in the past, are now distinct, and will be distinct, are not condemned by recluses and brahmins who are wise. Which three? (1) That material aggregate which is past, which has ceased, which is changed, is reckoned, termed, named “has been”;  it is not reckoned as “exists,” nor as “will be.” And so for the aggregates of feeling, perception, mental coefficients, consciousness. (2) That material aggregate which is not yet born, and which has not appeared, is reckoned, termed, named “will be,” but is not reckoned as “exists “nor as “has been.” And so for the mental aggregates. (3) That material body which has come to birth, has appeared, is reckoned, termed, named “exists,” but is not reckoned as “has been,” nor as “will be.” And so for the mental aggregates. Verily these three modes in word, term, or name, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are distinct, have been distinct in the past, are not, will not, be condemned by recluses and brahmins who are wise.</p>
<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, the folk of Ukkala, Lenten speakers of old,<a class="pc" id="pc96"></a> Casualists, Deniers of the Deed, Sceptics—even they, too, judged that these three modes of reckoning, terming, or naming, should not he condemned or repudiated. And why was that? Because they were afraid of blame, of unpopularity, of incurring opposition.”</p></div>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.61"></a>Again, did not the venerable Phagguna say to the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Does the eye (or sight), lord, still exist by which past Buddhas, who have completed existence, have cut off the multipliers of life, have cut off its cycle, have exhausted it, and utterly passed beyond all Suffering, might be revealed? Or does the ear, the nose, the tongue, the co-ordinating sense, still exist with which one might do this”? “No, Phagguna, the eye does not exist, nor any sense by which past Buddlias, who have so wrought, might be revealed.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus? Then it must surely not be said that “the past is,” “the future is.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.62"></a>Again, was it not said by the venerable Nandaba: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Formerly there was greed <span class="add">within him</span>, that was bad; that this no longer exists is good. Formerly there were hate and delusion, that was bad; that these no longer exist, that is good.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus? Surely then it should not be said that “the past exists.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.63"></a><span class="add">Sarvāstivādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“If <i>bhikkhus</i>, there be lust after, pleasure in, craving for, edible food, consciousness establishes itself and grows there. Wherever<a class="pc" id="pc97"></a> consciousness establishes itself and grows, there doth exist an entry for mind and body. Wherever an entry for mind-and body doth exist, there do grow mental coefficients. Wherever mental coefficients do grow, there re-becoming in the future doth exist. Wherever re-becoming in the future doth exist, there do follow future birth, decay, and dying. Wherever future birth, decay, and dying do exist, I, <i>bhikkhus</i>, do declare that to be accompanied by grief, anguish, and despair. And whether the “food” be edible, or contact, or act of will, or consciousness, I declare it to be accompanied by grief anguish, and despair.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus? Hence must it not surely be said “the future exists”?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs1.6.64"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not also said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“If there be no lust after, pleasure in, craving for, edible food, consciousness doth not establish itself or grow there. Wherever consciousness doth not establish itself and grow, there doth not exist an entry for mind and body. Wherever an entry for mind and body doth not exist, there doth exist no growth of mental coefficients. Wherever growth of mental coefficients doth not exist, there doth exist no future re-becoming. Wherever future re-becoming doth not exist, there doth exist no future birth, no decay and dying. Wherever there doth exist in the future no birth, decay, or dying, I declare, <i>bhikkhus</i>, that such edible food is not attend d by grief, anguish, and despair. Or whether the “food” be contact, or act of will,<a class="pc" id="pc98"></a> or consciousness, I declare it to be unattended by grief anguish, and despair.”</span></p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus? Surely then it should not he said that “the future exists.”</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
