<h1>15.3. Of Duration</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc295"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That duration is predetermined.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc296"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.3.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then must duration be one of the five aggregates, which of course it is not. This holds good whether you take past, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.3.2"></a> future, or present duration. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.3.3"></a> Now, you say that any past aggregate, bodily or mental, constitutes past duration; any future, any present aggregate, future or present duration respectively. Then are there five past durations, five future, five present durations?… <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.3.4"></a> fifteen durations in all? Or, if they are regarded as twelve past, future, present organs-and-objects-of-sense, are there thirty-six durations in all?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.3.5"></a>Or if we consider them as eighteen elements, are there fifty-four durations? or as controlling powers, are there sixty-six durations?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.3.6"></a><span class="add">opponent:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“There are these three subjects of discourse, <i>bhikkhus</i>—which are the three? One may talk about past time: “Thus was it in times past.” Or about future time: “Thus will it be in future times” Or about the present: “Thus is it now at present.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely duration is predetermined?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
