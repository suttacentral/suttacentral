<h1>8.3. Of the Pleasures of Sense</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc214"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the <i>kāma</i>-sphere means only the fivefold pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You admit, do you not, that desire, intention, zest, and joy, and the passion or lust that is involved in each, are all bound up with the fivefold pleasures of sense? How then can you maintain that the the sensual element is only those pleasures?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.3.2"></a>Do you mean that human organs of sense are not coextensive with the sensual element, the five organs of external sense and the co-ordinating sense, or mind? No, you say (meaning only the pleasures of sense in your proposition);  but think again as to mind… . Yes, you now say, mind is not the sensual element. But was it not said by the Exalted One: <a class="pc" id="pc215"></a></p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“There are five kinds of sensual pleasure in the world,<br>
And mind is known as the sixth;<br>
Having dispelled desire for these,<br>
Thus one is freed from suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence it cannot be said that the the sensual element does not include the mind.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.3.3"></a>Again, can you say that the pleasures of sense amount to a sphere of life, a destiny, a realm of beings, to renewed life, to a matrix, a station for consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Is there karma leading to them? Are there beings to be reborn in them? Do beings get born, grow old, die, decease, get reborn “in” sense-pleasures? Are there the five aggregates in them? Are they a five-mode existence? Are Buddhas Supreme, Silent Buddhas, Chief Pairs of disciples reborn in them? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.3.4"></a>All these things you can predicate of the “<i>kāma</i>-element,” but not one of them of the pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.3.5"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll"><i>Bhikkhus</i>, there are these fivefold <i>kāma</i>-pleasures—which are they? Objects desirable, sweet, agreeable, dear, connected with <i>kāma</i>, and seductive, are cognizable by sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch—these are the five kinds of <i>kāma</i> pleasures.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely the <i>kāma</i>-element is only those five. </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
