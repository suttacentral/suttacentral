<h1>5.2. Of the Knowledge of an Adept</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc174"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a learner has the insight of an adept.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you imply that the learner knows, sees the ideas of the adept, lives in the attainment of having seen, known, realized them, lives in personal contact therewith. If not—and you do deny this—then you cannot maintain your proposition.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.2.2"></a>We grant of course that the adept knows, sees the ideas of the adept, lives in the attainment… and so oil.<a class="pc" id="pc175"></a> But, as you have admitted, you cannot impute this knowledge to the learner.</p>
<p>Your position then is, that you credit the learner with the insight of an adept, yet you deny that the learner knows, sees the ideas of the adept, etc. But, the adept having also of course the insight of the adept, if he be as to insight on a level only with the learner, you must add of the adept also that he knows not, sees not the ideas of the adept, does not live in the attainment of having seen, known, realized them, does not live in personal contact therewith. Which is absurd, as you by your denial admit.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.2.3"></a>You are ready to deny that a person in a lower Stage of the Path has the insight as yet of the next higher Stage, or that one who is adopted has yet the insight of even the First Stage. How then can you ascribe the insight of those who have finally attained to those who as yet have not?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs5.2.4"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> If my proposition is wrong, then how is it that a learner, asĀnanda was, knew the sublimity of the Exalted One, or of the Elder Sāriputta, or of the Elder Moggallāna the Great?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
