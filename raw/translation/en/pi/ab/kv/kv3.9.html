<h1>3.9. Of Insight into Destiny according to Deeds</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc151"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the celestial eye amounts to insight into destiny according to deeds.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.9.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Your proposition involves this also: that in the act of vision, attention is also paid to the sequence of the Karma—which you did not allow. Or, if you do allow this, you are further implying a combination of two contacts and two consciousnesses—which you do not allow.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.9.2"></a><em>Either</em>, I repeat, you refuse to admit, that the act of seeing with the celestial eye involves judgment:” <em>these</em> beings, sirs, have plenty of evil deeds, words, and thoughts in their past: they are accusers of Ariyans, holders of erratic views, undertakers of actions in conformity therewith; now that their living frame is broken up, they are<a class="pc" id="pc152"></a> reborn in purgatory, in the abode of the fallen, the destiny of evil-doers, a woeful doom; but <em>those</em> folk, sirs, on the other hand, have plenty of good deeds, words, and thoughts to their account: the opposite of the foregoing; they are now reborn in a heaven to a happy destiny ”;  <em>or</em>, you accept this implication in celestial sight, and concede that <span class="add">in what is really one act of consciousness</span> there are two contacts (or mental stimuli) and two consciousnesses.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.9.3"></a>Again, if there have been those who, without this celestial vision, without having obtained, arrived at, and realized it, have had insight into destiny as being according to deeds, your proposition cannot stand. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs3.9.4"></a> The venerable Sāriputta, as you imagine, was such an one. Did he not say:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p> “Nor to attain the vision of my past,<br>
Nor for the means to see—the eye divine—<br>
The mystic power to read the thoughts of men,<br>
Discern decease, rebirth in earth and heaven,<br>
Nor for the ear. celestially attuned<br>
Cared I to strive.”</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
