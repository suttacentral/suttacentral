<h1>8.7. Of the Senses in the Rūpa-Sphere</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc218"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That in the Rūpa-sphere the individual has all the six senses.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If that be so, and one in that sphere have, say, the sense of smell, you must admit odorous objects for him to smell; and so too for the senses of taste and touch. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.2"></a> But you deny the existence, in that sphere, of such objects. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.6"></a> Yet it seems only rational that, admitting, as you do, the existence in that sphere of <em>both organ and object</em> in the case of sight, hearing, and <span class="add">sense-co-ordination or</span> mind, you should admit no less as to the other fields of<a class="pc" id="pc219"></a> sense, once yon affirm the existence, in that sphere, of any of the other sense-organs. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.7"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.8"></a>“No,” you say. You are prepared to admit organs of sight, hearing, and co-ordination, and corresponding objects seen, heard, and cognized by those organs; yet while you admit the other sense-organs, you deny the existence of their objects. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.9"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.10"></a> In fact, even if you were to concede the existence, in that sphere, of objects odorous, sapid, and tangible, you would, you say, deny they were apprehended by the corresponding organs, though you admit the corresponding apprehension in the case of sight, etc.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.11"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.13"></a>But there are among you some who <em>would</em> admit this apprehension of odours, tastes, and touches by the respective organs, the existence of which you affirm. I would ask them whether there exists in that sphere the odour of roots, pith, bark, leaves, flowers, fruit, raw flesh, poisonous, pleasant, or evil odours; whether there exists there also the taste of roots, pith, bark, leaves, flowers, fruit, or sour, sweet, bitter, pungent, saline, alkaline, acrid, astringent, nice, or nauseous tastes; whether there exist there also hard and soft, smooth and rough, pleasant and painful contacts, heavy and light tangibles? <em>You</em> deny that any of these does exist in that sphere… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs8.7.14"></a><span class="add">Andhakas and Sammitīyas:</span> But is there not in that sphere the wherewithal for smelling, tasting, touching? </p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhakas and Sammitīyas:</span> Surely then it is right to say that in the Rūpa-element the individual has all six senses? </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
