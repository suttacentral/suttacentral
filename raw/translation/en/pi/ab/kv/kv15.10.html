<h1>15.10. Of Cessation as a Means of reaching the Unconscious Sphere</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc300"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling conduces to rebirth in the unconscious sphere.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.10.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Can you say of anyone who has attained to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling that <span class="add">in his character</span> are the three moral conditions—absence of greed, of hate, of delusion, also faith, energy, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, and understanding? Is not the contrary <span class="add">usually</span> the case?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.10.2"></a>You admit of course that one in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling is without mental reaction, feeling, perception, volition, cognition? But you cannot maintain that a Path can be practised in the absence of these. </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.10.3"></a>Finally, your proposition implies that all who attain to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling are tending to rebirth in the Unconscious Sphere—which you must deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.10.4"></a><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span> But you admit, anyway, that in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling one is unconscious, and in that sphere one is unconscious. Hence I maintain that this tendency is a fact.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
