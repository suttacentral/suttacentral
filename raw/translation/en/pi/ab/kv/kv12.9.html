<h1>12.9. Of Evil Tendency</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc270"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That for a person holding sound views evil tendencies are eliminated.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc271"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.9.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.9.4"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you concede that such a person <span class="add">though safe as to his destiny</span> may still get infatuated with any purgatorial objects of sense, may commit fornication with females that are not human, whether demons, animals, or fairies;  may keep worldly possessions, such as goats and sheep, poultry and swine, elephants, cattle, horses and mules, partridges, quails, peacocks and pheasants. If you assent to all this, your proposition cannot stand. Moreover, you cannot possibly admit all this in the case of an Arahant. Contrariwise, you repudiate it for him, while you admit (as you must) that it may prove true for one who has <span class="add">merely</span> sound views.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.9.5"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> Then if I am wrong, <em>you</em> imply that the person holding sound views may yet be reborn in purgatory, in the animal kingdom, in the realm of the Petas? If you deny, you must also retract your contradiction.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
