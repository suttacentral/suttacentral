<h1>16.3. Of making Another Happy according to his Deserts</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc304"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one can bestow happiness on others.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc305"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.3.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Your proposition implies that one can also cause misery in others. But you deny this, while you maintain the opposite with respect to happiness. </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.3.2"></a>You imply further that you can hand over your own happiness to another; or others’ happiness, or his own happiness, to another. You deny. To whom then? You imply, finally, that anyone causes another to act for him, that one’s own welfare and suffering are wrought by another, that one acts while another experiences.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.3.3"></a><span class="add">Hetuvādins:</span> But did not the venerable Udayin say:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Truly, many sufferings the Exalted One has rid us of, many happinesses has he given us, many bad things he has rid us of, many good things he has he given us.”</span></p>
<p>Hence one may hand on happiness to another.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
