<h1>19.2. Of Emptiness</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc335"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That “Emptiness” is included in the aggregate of mental co-efficients (<i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you then imply that the “Signless,” that the “Desireless” is also so included? If not, <a class="pc" id="pc336"></a> “Emptiness” cannot be, <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.2.2"></a> for you cannot predicate of the last that which you deny of the former two.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.2.3"></a>Again, if the fourth aggregate be made to include “Emptiness,” it must be not impermanent, not arisen through a cause, not liable to perish, nor to lose lust, nor to cease, nor to change!</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.2.4"></a>Moreover, is the “emptiness” of the material aggregate included under the fourth aggregate? Or the “emptiness” of the second, third, and fifth aggregates thereunder? Or is the “emptiness ” of the fourth aggregate itself included under any of the other four? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.2.5"></a> If the one inclusion is wrong, so are all the other inclusions.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.2.5"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Empty is this, <i>bhikkhus</i>—the <i>saṅkhāras</i>—either of soul or of what belongs to soul”</span></p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
