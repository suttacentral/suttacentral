<h1>14.4. Of the Outward Life of an Ariyan</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc286"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Ariyan “forms” <span class="add">of speech and action</span> are derived from the four primary qualities of matter.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc287"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.4.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You admit that the qualities of the Ariyan are moral, and not unmoral. But the primary qualities of matter are not moral; they are unmoral… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.4.2"></a>Again, there is in these primary qualities nothing akin to the absence of intoxicant, fetter, tie, flood, bond, hindrance, infection, grasping, corruption, characteristic of the Ariyan’s qualities. On the contrary, the former are concomitant with these <span class="add">ethically undesirable things</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.4.3"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Whatever matter there is, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is the four primary qualities and their derivatives.”</span></p>
<p>Hence it is surely right to say that the material qualities of the Ariyan are derived from the primary qualities.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
