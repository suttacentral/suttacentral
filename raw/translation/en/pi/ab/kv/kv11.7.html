<h1>11.7. Of the Causality of Things</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc261"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a cause of things is predetermined.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc262"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.7.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is then the cause of causes predetermined <span class="add">by something else</span>? You deny. For if you assent, you commit yourself to this: that, because of the continued eventuating due to endless causation, there can never be an end made to Suffering, nor any cutting off the round of rebirth, nor any <i>Nibbāna</i> free from the residual stuff of rebirth.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.7.2"></a>Again, is the cause of any one of the five aggregates (body, mind) predetermined? If you assent, you commit yourself to the admission that the cause itself is predetermined by something else. And if you deny—and I insist, and take no denial—you, assenting, commit yourself to this—that there is, for this endless causation, no making an end of Suffering, no cutting off of the round of rebirth, no <i>Nibbāna</i> without stuff of rebirth… . </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
