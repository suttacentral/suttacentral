<h1>21.2. Of Experience as Inseparable from Personality</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc352"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That an ordinary person is not exempt from experiencing the phenomena of all the three spheres of life.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You imply that an ordinary person is inseparable from the contacts, the feelings, perceptions, volitions, cognitions, faiths, efforts, mindfulnesses, <i>samādhi</i>s, understandings, belonging to all three spheres? You deny; but what else can you mean?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.2.2"></a>Again, you imply that when he makes a gift, say, of cloth, etc , at that moment he is enjoying not only the giver’s consciousness, but also the Rūpa-consciousness of the Four <i>jhāna</i>s, the Arūpa-consciousness of the four Arūpa-<i>jhāna</i>s.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.2.3"></a><span class="add">Opponent:</span> But is an ordinary person capable of distinguishing whether his actions leading to a Rūpa-world or Arūpa-world? If not, then surely he cannot be separated from actions leading to all three spheres.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
