<h1>6.6. Of Space</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc192"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That space is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> II space is unconditioned, as you affirm, you must class it with <i>Nibbāna</i>, or you must affirm two <span class="add">sorts of</span> unconditioned—and so two <i>Nibbāna</i>s—all of which you deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.6.2"></a>Can anyone make space where there has been no space? Then one can make that which is conditioned unconditioned—which you deny… . So, too, for the reverse process… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.6.3"></a>Again, if you admit that birds go through space, moon, sun, and stars go through space, supernormal movement is worked in space, the arm or hand is waved in space, clods, clubs, a supernormally moved person, arrows are projected through space, you must state as much about movement through or in the unconditioned—which you cannot… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.6.4"></a>Again, if people enclose space when they make houses or barns, do they enclose the unconditioned? Or when a well is dug, does non-space become space? Yes? Then does the unconditioned become conditioned? Or, when an empty well, or an empty barn, or an empty jar, is filled, does “space” disappear? If so, does the unconditioned disappear?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.6.5"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas and Mahīsāsakas:</span> If then it is wrong to say space is unconditioned, is it conditioned? You deny. Then it must be unconditioned.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
