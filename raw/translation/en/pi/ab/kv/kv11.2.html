<p><a class="pc" id="pc255"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it is wrong to say “he has insight” of one who, though he has banished delusion, has thoughts not conjoined with insight.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must also admit it is not right to say that, when lust has departed, a man has “done with lust.” Similarly for hate, and for delusion, and for worldly corruptions generally. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs11.2.2"></a> If, on the contrary, you maintain that it is right to affirm these latter propositions, then it is no less right to say, of one for whom delusion is departed, but for whom cognition not conjoined with insight is active, that he has insight.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
