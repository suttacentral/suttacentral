<h1>22.3. Of Imperturbable (Fourth Jhāna) Consciousness</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc359"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Arahant completes existence in imperturbable absorption (<i>aneñja</i>).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But does he not complete existence with ordinary (or normal) consciousness? You agree. How, then do you reconcile this with your proposition?</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc360"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.3.2"></a> You are implying that he passes away with an ethically inoperative consciousness. Is it not rather with a consciousness that is pure “result”? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.3.3"></a> Whereas according to you he passes away with a consciousness that is unmoral and purely inoperative, I suggest that it is with a consciousness that is unmoral and purely resultant.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.3.4"></a>And did not the Exalted One emerge from Fourth <i>jhāna</i> before he passed utterly away immediately after?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
