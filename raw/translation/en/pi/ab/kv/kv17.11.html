<h1>17.11. Of the Sanctification of the Gift</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc321"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a gift is sanctified by the giver only, not by the recipient.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc322"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.11.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Now are not some who receive gifts “worthy of offerings, attentions, gifts, salutations, the world’s supreme field of merit”? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.11.2"></a> And did not the Exalted One pronounce the four pairs of men, the eight kinds of individuals to be worthy of gifts? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.11.3"></a> And are there not those who, having offered a gift to a Stream-Winner, Once-Returner, Never- Returner or Arahant, make the gift effective? How then can you maintain your proposition?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.11.4"></a><span class="add">Uttaiapathakas:</span> But if a gift may be sanctified by the recipient, does not he become the agent for quite a different person? Does not one person work the happiness or the misery of another? Does not one sow, another reap?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Now was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“There are four ways, Ānanda, of sanctifying a gift. Which are the four? A gift may be sanctified by the giver, not by the recipient;  a gift may be sanctified by the recipient, not by the giver; or it may be sanctified by both; or, again, by neither.”</span></p>
<p>Hence it is surely wrong to say: “A gift is sanctified only by the giver, not by the recipient.”</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
