<h1>4.2. Of <span class="add">Arahantship as conferred by</span> Rebirth <span class="add">alone</span></h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc158"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one may become Arahant at the moment of rebirth.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc159"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.2"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You affirm this proposition; yet you deny that one can become at birth either a Stream-Winner, Once-Returner, or Never-Returner.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.3"></a>And you can name none—not even the greatest—who were Arahants from the time of birth—Sāriputta, or the Great Theras: Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kaccāyana, Koṭṭhika or Panthaka. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.4"></a> You deny it in fact of all of them.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.6"></a>Consider our consciousness at rebirth: it arises because rebirth has been desired. Now such a mind is worldly, co-intoxicant… corrupt. Can it realize Arahantship? Is it of the kind that is called forthleading, that goes toward extinction, enlightenment, disaccumulating, is free from defilements… and corruptions? Can one by it put away lust, and hate, delusion … indiscretion? Is it the Ariyan Path, the applications of mindfulness and the rest of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment? Can it understand Suffering, put away its cause, realize its cessation, develop the path thereto? All this you, of course, must deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs4.2.6a"></a>Or is the last act of consciousness at death the realization of the Topmost Path (of Arahantship) and the ensuing act of consciousness at rebirth the Fruit of that Path (or full realization of Arahantship)? You deny again. Then your proposition is proved false.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
