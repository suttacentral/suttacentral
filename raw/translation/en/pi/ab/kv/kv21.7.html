<p><a class="pc" id="pc355"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That all things are by nature immutable.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc356"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.7.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you mean that they all belong to that Saṅgha of things, by which the wrong-doer is assured of immediate retribution on rebirth, or to that other Saṅgha by which the Path-winner is assured of final salvation? Is there not a third congeries that is not fixed as one or the other? You deny. But think. Surely there is? You assent. Then you contradict your proposition. And you must do so, for did not the Exalted One speak of three congeries?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.7.3"></a>You affirm <span class="add">as your reason</span> that matter is fixed as matter, and that mind (or each mental aggregate) is fixed as mind. Well, then, under which of those three congeries do you find them fixed?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs21.7.4"></a><span class="add">Andhakas and Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if I may not say that matter, or mind is fixed as matter, or mind respectively, tell me, can body become mind, can become one of the four mental aggregates, or conversely? Of course not. Surely then I am right.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
