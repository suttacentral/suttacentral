<h1>14.8. Of the Unmoral and the Unrevealed</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc290"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That error is unmoral.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must be prepared to class it as one of the unmoral categories—result, inoperative consciousness, matter, <i>Nibbāna</i>, organ and object of sense—which you may not do. You must also be prepared to admit that other mental factors, the conscious processes or acts accompanying erroneous opinion, are unmoral. Else you have this anomaly: that all these together constitute a state of immoral consciousness, while the erroneous opinion alone is unmoral.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.8.2"></a>Again, the unmoral has no moral fruit or result, while erroneous opinion is of the opposite nature. No, were not evil views ranked as paramount offences by the Exalted One?<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.8.3"></a> Did he not say: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Wrong views, Vaccha, are immoral, right views are moral.”</span></p>
<p>And did he not say also: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“For the holder of wrong views, Puṇṇa, I declare one of two destinies, either purgatory or the animal world.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc291"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.8.4"></a><span class="add">Andhakas and Uttarapāthakas:</span> But did not the Exalted One say:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“This, Vaccha, is unsolved (<i>avyākata</i>): that the world is eternal, or that it is not eternal. This, too, is unsolved (<i>avyākata</i>)—that the world is finite, or that it is infinite. And so, too, are these: that the soul and the body are the same, or are different things;  that a Tathāgata comes to be after death, or not, or both comes to be and does not come to be, or that neither happens.”</span></p>
<p>Surely then erroneous opinions are unmoral.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.8.5"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Of a person holding wrong views, <i>bhikkhus</i>, whatever karma of deed, word and thought he completes and carries out in accordance with those views, be it volition, aspiration, adjustment of mind, or other activities, all those things conduce to the undesirable, to the unpleasant, to the disagreeable, to trouble, to suffering.”</span></p>
<p>Hence it is surely wrong to say that “erroneous opinions are unmoral.”</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
