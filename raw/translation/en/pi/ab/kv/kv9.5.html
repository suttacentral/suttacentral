<h1>9.5. Of Insight as without Mental Object</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc236"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That insight is without mental object.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.5.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then insight must be either material quality, or <i>Nibbāna</i>, or one of the five organs of sense, or their five external objects (since these are the things that are without <em>mental</em> object). But this you deny… .</p>
<p>You deny also that understanding, as controlling power or force, as right views, as the search for truth by intuition, is without mental object, affirming the contrary. Then why exclude insight?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.5.2"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.5.4"></a>Here, too, you judge that the aggregate of mental coefficients is involved. But as in the preceding discourse, so here: you cannot say, a mental aggregate is without object, or partly so. And you cannot affirm that understanding, which is involved in that aggregate, is with mental object, while insight, also involved in it, is without.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc237"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.5.5"></a> <span class="add">Andhakas:</span> You deny that insight is objectless. Is it right to say that the Arahant is “full of insight,” while he is visually cognitive?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> Has his insight at that moment an object?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> No, that cannot truly be said… . <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.5.6"></a> But if you substitute “full of understanding” for “full of insight,” you yourself admit that he is full of understanding while visually cognitive, and at the same time you deny that his understanding, during that process, has an object.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
