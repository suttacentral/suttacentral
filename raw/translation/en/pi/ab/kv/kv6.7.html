<h1>6.7. Of Space as visible</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc193"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That space is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.7.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If this is so, you commit yourself to saying that space is visible material, visible object and element, and therefore, as such, is either blue-green, yellow, red, or white, is cognizable by the eye, impinges on the eye or organ of vision, enters into the avenue of sight—which you deny… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.7.2"></a>Substituting “space” for “visible object,” you must affirm or deny that “because of eye and space visual consciousness arises.” If not, your proposition falls through. If you agree, you cannot quote any Suttanta to establish this. All that the Suttanta says is:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Because of eye and visible object visual consciousness arises.”</span></p>
<p>As you agree. Hence you must either call space visible object (with its properties), or fail to maintain your position.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs6.7.3"></a><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> If I am wrong, you must nevertheless admit that you “see” the interval between two trees or two posts, the space in a keyhole or in a window. Surely then space is visible.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
