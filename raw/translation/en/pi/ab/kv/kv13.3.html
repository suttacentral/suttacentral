<h1>13.3. Of Abettors of Cardinal Crimes</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc274"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That a person who, as abettor, is involved in “immediate retribution” may enter on the True Path of Assurance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.3.1"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> Do you mean that such a culpable abettor can enter on both the False and the True Path of Assurance? If you deny, neither can you affirm your proposition.</p>
<p>Again, if he become worried and uneasy after his connection with the deed, how can he ever enter on the True Path of Assurance?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.3.2"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You say he is incapable of entering on that Path. But are you assuming that one or other of the five cardinal crimes has actually been committed <span class="add">through his abettment</span>? Your proposition implies this.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc275"></a>Again, you affirm that an abettor of such crimes, when he has withdrawn his instigation, and has dispelled his worry and remorse, is still incapable of entering upon the True Path of Assurance. Hereby you imply that some one of the grave misdeeds just named has been actually committed <span class="add">at his instigation</span>. But can you maintain your position in the face of his reforming before the commis-sion of the act?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.3.3"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But has he not previously instigated someone to commit it? How then can you judge him capable of entering on the True Path of Assurance?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
