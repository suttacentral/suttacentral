<h1>17.6. Of the Saṅgha and the Accepting of Gifts</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc318"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it ought not to be said “The Saṅgha accepts gifts.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.6.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But is not the Saṅgha worthy of offerings of hospitality, of gifts, of salutations, as the world’s supreme field of merit? How then can it be wrong to say it accepts gifts? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.6.2"></a> Were not its four pairs of men, its eight classes of individuals declared by the Exalted One to be worthy of gifts? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.6.3"></a> And are there not they who give to it?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.6.4"></a>Finally, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Like the oblation for the Sacred Flame,<br>
Like a great storm on Mother Earth,<br>
The Saṅgha, endowed with <i>samādhi</i>,<br>
receives offerings.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence surely the Saṅgha accepts gifts.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.6.5"></a><span class="add">Mahāsuññāvādins:</span> But can a Path accept? Can Fruition accept?… </p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
