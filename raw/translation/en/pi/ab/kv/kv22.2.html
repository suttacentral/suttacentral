<h1>22.2. Of Moral Consciousness</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc358"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the Arahant is ethically conscious when completing existence at final death.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.2.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You are implying that an Arahant is achieving karma of merit, or karma of imperturbable character; that<a class="pc" id="pc359"></a> he is working karma affecting destiny, and rebirth, conducive to worldly authority and influence, to wealth and reputation, to beauty celestial or human… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.2.2"></a>You are implying that the Arahant, when he is passing away, is accumulating or pulling down, is eliminating or grasping, is scattering or binding, is dispersing or collecting. Is it not true of him that he stands, as Arahant, neither heaping up nor pulling down, as one who has pulled down? That he stands, as Arahant, neither putting off nor grasping at, as one who has put off? As neither scattering nor binding, as one who has scattered? As neither dispersing nor collecting, as one who has dispersed?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs22.2.3"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But does not an Arahant pass utterly away with lucid presence of mind, mindful and aware? You agree. Then is this not “good “consciousness?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
