<h1>2.11. Of Cessation</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc136"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That there are two cessations <span class="add">of sorrow</span>.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc137"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.11.1"></a>If you assert that there are two kinds of cessation, you must also assert this duality with respect to the cessation of Suffering, the Truth about the cessation of Suffering, the Truth about the nature of Suffering, its cause, and the path leading to the cessation of Suffering—to none of which you consent.</p>
<p>Further, you must assert that there are two shelters, two retreats, two refuges, two supports, two deathlessnesses, two ambrosias, two <i>Nibbāna</i>s—which you deny. Or if you admit that there are, say, two <i>Nibbāna</i>s, you must admit some specific difference, say, of high, low, base, sublime, superior, inferior—some boundary, division, line or cleavage in these two <i>Nibbāna</i>s—which you deny.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.11.2"></a>Further, you admit, do you not, that things which have ceased without deep reflection, may also be made<a class="pc" id="pc138"></a> to cease by deep reflection? But this does not involve two (final) cessations.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.11.3"></a><span class="add">Mahīsāsakas and Andhakas:</span> Surely it does, if you admit, as do you not, that things which have ceased without, and those that have ceased by, deep reflection are both annihilated for ever?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.11.4"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> You admit that the latter class of things ceases because the Ariyan <span class="add">eightfold</span> Path has been attained? Then must you also admit that the former class of things ceases for the same reason—but you do not.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs2.11.5"></a>Again, the latter class (i.e., things which have ceased by deep reflection) does not, according to. you, ever arise again. Then you must also admit this of the former class—but you do not… . Hence cessation is really one, not two.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
