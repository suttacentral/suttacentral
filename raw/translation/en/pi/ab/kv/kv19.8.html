<h1>19.8. Of the Moral Controlling Powers</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc342"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the five moral controlling powers—faith, effort, mindfulness, <i>samādhi</i>, understanding—are not valid as controlling powers in worldly matters.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that there can be no faith, or effort, or mindfulness, or <i>samādhi</i>, or understanding in worldly concerns? You deny. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.2"></a> On the other hand, you maintain that there is faith, etc., in such a connection, but that none of them avail for moral control.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.3"></a>You admit that both mind and mind as a controlling power are valid in worldly matters. And you admit a similar validity in both joy and joy as a controlling power, in both psychic life and psychic life as a controlling power.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.4"></a>Why then exempt those five?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.5"></a>Again, you admit that there is both a spiritual faith and a controlling power of that faith—why not both a worldly faith and a worldly controlling power of faith? And so for the rest. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.6"></a> Why accept in the one case, deny in the other?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.8.7"></a>Moreover, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“And I, <i>bhikkhus</i>, with the eyes of a Buddha surveying the world, saw beings living whose vision was dim with dust, in some but slightly, greatly in others, beings whose faculties were here keen, there blunt, of good disposition… apt to learn… some among them discerning the danger and defect of <span class="add">rebirth in</span> other worlds.”</span></p>
<p>Surely then the five moral controlling powers are valid in worldly matters.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
