<h1>9.9. Of Speech conforming to Thought</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc240"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That speech does not accord with thought.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.9.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> If this be so, then a <em>fortiori</em> neither does speech accord with mental contact, feeing, perception, volition, nor with any property of consciousness. But surely, as you agree, the opposite is the case.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc241"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.9.2"></a> You must, again, deny that speech accords with adverting, ideating, co-ordinated application, willing, intending, aiming—which you will not, the opposite being true.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.9.3"></a>You admit that speech which is provoked by thought is co-existent, and one in its origin, with the thought. Yet this is in contradiction to your proposition.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.9.4"></a>Again, you commit yourself to this, that one speaks of what one does not wish to speak, discourses, addresses <span class="add">others</span>, converses about what one does not wish. Surely the opposite is the case.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs9.9.5"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas:</span> You say I am wrong, but you must admit that people can speak, discourse, address <span class="add">others</span>, converse about something different <span class="add">from that which is occupying their minds</span>. Hence my proposition is tenable.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
