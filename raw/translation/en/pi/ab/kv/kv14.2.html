<h1>14.2. Of the Development of Sense-Organs</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc283"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the sense-mechanism starts all at once to life in the womb.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc284"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.2.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you imply that the sense-mechanism enters the womb with all its main and minor parts complete, not deficient in any organ? You deny… <span class="add">Then let us speak more in detail: </span> You admit that the organ of sight starts by consciousness seeking rebirth? Now, you would not claim, for that questing consciousness that <span class="add">at its taking effect</span> hands, feet, head, ears, nostrils, mouth and teeth take their start? Why claim an exception in the case of the visual, or other sense-organs?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.2.2"></a><span class="add">Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas:</span> Then you claim that four of the senseorgans—eye, ear, smell, taste—come later into being. Are you implying that, to bring this about, one makes karma in the mother “s womb? You deny, but your position implies it.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you say, do you not, that in the embryo hair, down, nails, teeth, bones, appear at a subsequent stage. Do <em>you</em> imply a special embryonic karma done to bring these to birth? You deny. Then why assail my position? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs14.2.3"></a> Or it may be you do not admit the subsequent appearance of hair, etc.? But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“At first the <i>kalala</i> takes birth, and then<br>
The <i>abbuda</i>. Therefrom the <i>pesi</i> grows,<br>
Developing as <i>ghana</i> in its turn.<br>
Now in the <i>ghana</i> appears the hair,<br>
The down, the nails. And whatsoever food<br>
<a class="pc" id="pc285"></a>
And drink the mother of him takes,<br>
thereby the man in mother’s womb does live and grow.”
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence it is right to assign a later appearance to hair, and so forth.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
