<h1>16.9. Of Matter as belonging to the Material and the Immaterial Heavens.</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc309"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That matter belongs to (i.) the material heavens, (ii.) the immaterial heavens.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc310"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.9.1"></a> <span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Then you must describe matter <span class="add">in terms descriptive of (i.) that is to say</span> as seeking attainment in <i>jhāna</i>, as seeking rebirth on those planes, as living happily under present conditions, as accompanied by a mind that seeks that attainment and that rebirth, and that lives in that happiness;  as coexistent with such a mind, associated, conjoined with it, one with it in genesis, in cessation, in physical basis, as having the same objects before it… <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.9.2"></a> and you must describe matter <span class="add">in terms descriptive of (ii.) that is to say</span> in the same terms as we apply to (i.). But is not the contrary true as to both (i.) and (ii.)?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs16.9.3"></a><span class="add">Andhakas:</span> But is not matter which is due to actions done in the world of sense-desires called “belonging to” that world? If that is so, then matter due to actions done in either of the other worlds of existence should surely be called “belonging to” either the Material Heavens or the Immaterial Heavens.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
