<h1>12.3. Of Sound as Result <span class="add">of Karma</span></h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc266"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That sound is a result of karma.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.3.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <span class="add">Now what can rightly be predicated of a “result of karma”?</span> Such a result is a matter of feeling, pleasant, painful, or neutral; it is conjoined with feeling<a class="pc" id="pc267"></a> of these three kinds; it is conjoined with mental contact, feeling, perception, volition, thought; it goes with a mental object; with it go adverting, ideating, co-ordinated application, attention, volition, anticipation, aiming. Is sound anything of this kind? Is it not rather the opposite”?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.3.2"></a>Now mental contact is result of karma, and of mental contact it is right to predicate any of the foregoing characteristics, and wrong not to. But the opposite holds with regard to sound.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs12.3.3"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“He through having wrought, having accumulated, having piled up, having increased such karma, becomes reborn with the voice of a Brahma god, like that of the <i>karavika</i> bird.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely sound is a specific result of karma.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
