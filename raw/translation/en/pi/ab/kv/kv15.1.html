<h1>15.1. Of Correlation as specifically fixed</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc293"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one phenomenon can be related to another in one way only.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But take the attitude of investigation, is not that correlated both as moral condition and as dominance? You assent. Then your proposition falls through.</p>
<p>Again, is not predominant desire-to-do the dominant factor in coexistent mental states? If so, we ought to admit a dual correlation by way of (i.) dominance, (ii.) co-existence. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.2"></a> The same holds when energy is the dominant factor. Or if dominant energy be considered as “controlling power” or faculty (<i>indriya</i>), we ought to admit a dual correlation by way of dominance and controlling power. Or if we consider dominant energy as a factor of the Path,we ought to admit a dual correlation by way of dominance and path or means (<i>magga</i>). <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.3"></a> The same holds when apperception is the dominant factor. Or if dominant consciousness be considered as nutriment (or cause, <i>āhāra</i>),<a class="pc" id="pc294"></a> we ought to admit a dual correlation by way of dominance and nutriment. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.4"></a> The argument holds when we consider conscious dominance as controlling power, or investigation as a dominant factor, or, again, as part of the Path, or means.</p>
<p>Once more, if, on adequately revering an Ariyan phenomenon, reflection arises having that phenomenon as its dominant object, we ought here to admit the dual relation—dominance and object.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.5"></a>Or again, if this or that previous moral consciousness be related to this or that subsequent moral consciousness as consecutive, and is also repeated, have we not to admit here the dual correlation of contiguity and repetition? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.6"></a> The same being valid for immoral states? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.7"></a> The same correlation being valid if, for moral, or immoral, we substitute “inoperative” or “unmoral” states?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs15.1.8"></a><span class="add">Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> Nevertheless, you admit the definitely distinct modes of correlation, such as “moral condition, or <i>hetu</i>,” contiguity, immediate succession? Then surely my proposition is right.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
