<h1>17.10. Of the Buddha and the Fruit of Giving</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc321"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That it should not be said that “Anything given to the Buddha brings great reward.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.10.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Now was not the Exalted One of all two-footed creatures the highest and best and foremost and uttermost, supreme, unequalled, unrivalled, peerless, incomparable, unique? How then could a gift to Him fail to bring great reward? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.10.2"></a> Are there any equal to Him in virtue, in will, in intellect?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs17.10.3"></a>And was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Neither in this world nor in any other is any to be found better than, or equal to the Buddha who has reached the summit of them who are worthy of offerings, who are desirous of merit, who seek abundant fruit.”</span></p>
<p>Hence surely anything given to the Buddha brings great reward.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
