<h1>19.7. Of Assurance which is not Final</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc340"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the average man may possess final assurance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you mean that he has that assurance even if he commit the worst crimes—matricide, parricide, Arahanticide, wounding a Buddha, breaking up the Saṅgha? “No,” you say.</p>
<p>Again, could an average man holding that assurance feel doubt about it? “Yes,” you say. Then he cannot feel assured.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.2"></a>Surely you agree that, if he feel assured, he cannot feel doubt. Now has he put away doubt? “No,” you say. But think! You now assent. Then has he put away doubt by the First Path? or the Second, Third, or Fourth Path? How, then?</p>
<p><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> By a bad path.</p>
	
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <span class="add">Do you tell me that</span> a bad path leads aright, goes to the destruction <span class="add">of lust, hate, etc.</span>, goes to enlightenment, is immune from defilements, is undefiled? Is it not the opposite of all this?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.3"></a>Could the Annihilationist view be adopted by a person assured and convinced of the truth of the Eternalist<a class="pc" id="pc341"></a> view? “Yes,” you say. Surely then the assurance of the average man in his Annihilationist convictions is no “infinite assurance.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.4"></a>If you now deny in reply to my question, I ask again, has he put away <span class="add">the Annihilationist view</span>? If so, by which of the Four Paths? You reply, as before, “By a bad pa<span class="add">Theravādin:</span> ” That is to say, by a bad path he puts away a bad view… .</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.6"></a>A similar argument may be put forward for an Annhilationist who adopts the Eternalist view.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.7"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> If I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a person whose mental states are entirely black-hearted and immoral—he it is who, once immersed, is so once for all.”</span></p>
<p>Surely then any average man can attain infinite assurance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.8"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Is that which you have quoted your reason for maintaining your proposition? You admit it is. Now the Exalted One said further:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a person who, having come to the surface, is immersed.</span></p> 
<p>Now is this <span class="add">supposed to be</span> happening all the time? Of course not… . <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.7.9"></a> But again he said:</p>
<p><span class="sutta_ll">“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a person who, having emerged, so <span class="add">remains</span>; of one who, having emerged, discerns, glances around; of one who, having emerged, swims across; of one who, having emerged, wins a footing on the shore.”</span></p>
<p>Now is each of these persons doing so all the time?</p>
<p>And does any of these cases furnish you with a reason for saying that any average person can have final assurance <span class="add">in his convictions</span>?</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
