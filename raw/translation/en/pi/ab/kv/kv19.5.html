<h1>19.5. Of “Thusness.”</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc338"></a> <span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That the fundamental characteristics of all things (<i>sabba-dhamma</i>) are unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.5.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do you then identify those fundamental characteristics or “thusness” with <i>Nibbāna</i>, the Shelter… the Goal, the Undying, the Deathless? Or are there two “unconditioneds”? You deny both alternatives <span class="add">but you must assent to one or the other</span>. If to the latter, I ask, are there two kinds of Shelters and so on? And is there a boundary or… interstice between them?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.5.2"></a>Again, assuming a materiality (<i>rūpatā</i>) of matter or body, is not materiality unconditioned? You assent. Then I raise the same difficulties as before.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.5.3"></a>I raise them, too, if you admit a “hedonality” of feeling, a “perceivability” of perception, a <i>saṅkhāratā</i> or<a class="pc" id="pc339"></a> co-efficiency of mental co-efficients, a consciousness of being conscious. If all these be unconditioned, are there then six categories of “unconditioneds”?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs19.5.4"></a><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> But if I am wrong, is the “thusness “of all things the five aggregates <span class="add">taken together</span>?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="add">Uttarapāthakas:</span> Then that “thusness” of all things is unconditioned.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
