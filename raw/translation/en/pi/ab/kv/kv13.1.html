<h1>13.1. Of Age-Long Penalty</h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc272"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That one doomed to age-long retribution must endure it for a whole aeon.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But this implies that the cycle may start when a Buddha is born into the world, or when the Saṅgha is dissolved, or when the condemned person is committing the act incurring the penalty, or when he is dying… . </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.1.2"></a>It also implies that if he live for a past aeon, he may live for a future one—nay, for two, three, or four… . </p>
<p>And if during his aeon there be a cosmic conflagration, whither will he go?</p>
<p><span class="add">Rājagirikas:</span> To another plane of the universe.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Do the dead go thither? Do they go to the sky?</p>
<p><span class="add">Rājagirikas:</span> The dead go.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> Can the act involving the penalty take effect in a subsequent life? You must deny… . Hence he must go to the sky. This implies that he has Psychic Power—<a class="pc" id="pc273"></a> else he could not. Now can one doomed to age-long retribution practise the four steps to Psychic Power—will, effort, thought, investigation?… </p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs13.1.3"></a><span class="add">Rājagirikas:</span> But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One: </p>
<div class="sutta_ll"><blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Doomed to the downfall, to hell for an aeon <br>
Is the one who causes a schism in the Saṅgha.<br>
Attached to division, intent on the unrighteous,<br>
One falls away from the security from bondage.<br>
Having split a Saṅgha in harmony,<br>
One burns in hell for an aeon.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence my proposition is true.</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
