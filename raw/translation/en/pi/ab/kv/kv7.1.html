<h1>7.1. Of the Classification <span class="add">of Dhammas</span></h1>
</div>

<p><a class="pc" id="pc195"></a><span class="add">Controverted Point:</span> That <i>dhammas</i> cannot be grouped together by means of abstract ideas.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.1"></a><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> But you do not also deny that any <i>dhammas</i> may combine or be included with other <i>dhammas</i> under a concept of totality or universality. Hence, how can you deny that they may be grouped together? <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.2"></a>The organs of sense <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.3"></a> and their objects are, you admit, computed under the material aggregate <span class="add">of a living individual</span>. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.4"></a> Pleasant, painful, or neutral feelings are computed under the aggregate of feeling. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.5"></a> Percepts on occasion of sense and ideation come under the aggregate of perception. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.6"></a> Volitions on occasion of sense and ideation come under the aggregate of conscious concomitants. <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.7"></a> Consciousness on occasion of sense and ideation comes under the aggregate of consciousness. Hence, by admitting these inclusions, you must admit that <i>dhammas</i> may be grouped by an idea.</p>
<p><a class="pc" id="pc196"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs7.1.8"></a> <span class="add">Rājagirikas and the Siddhatthikas:</span> Then you understand “<i>dhammas</i> being grouped together by ideas” in the same way as two bullocks may be grouped together by a rope or a yoke, an alms-bowl may be held together by a suspender, a dog may be held in by a leash?</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <span class="add">Yes; and</span> hence it is not less right to say that some <i>dhammas</i> may be grouped together by other <i>dhammas</i> (ideas).</p>

<p><cite class="book">The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class="author">Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class="author">C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, 1915.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
