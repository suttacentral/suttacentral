<li>void of idea,</li>
<li>neither feeling, nor perception, nor synthesis,</li>
<li>disconnected with thought,</li>
<li>neither moral result, nor productive of moral result,</li>
<li>uncorrupted yet belonging to corruption,</li>
<li>not that ‘where conception works and thought discursive’,</li>
<li>not that ‘wherein is no working of conception, but only of thought discursive’,</li>
<li>void of ‘the working of conception and of thought discursive’,</li>
<li>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en170"></a>not ‘accompanied by joy’,</li>
<li>not ‘accompanied by ease’,</li>
<li>not ‘accompanied by disinterestedness’,</li>
<li>not something capable of being got rid of either by insight or by cultivation,</li>
<li>not that the cause of which may be got rid of either by insight or by cultivation,</li>
<li>neither tending to, nor away from, the accumulation involving re-birth,</li>
<li>belonging neither to studentship nor to that which is beyond studentship,</li>
<li>limited,</li>
<li>related to the universe of sense,</li>
<li>not related to the universe of form,</li>
<li>nor to that of the formless,</li>
<li>included,</li>
<li>not of the Unincluded,</li>
<li>not something entailing inevitable retribution,</li>
<li>unavailing for (ethical) guidance,</li>
<li>cognizable when apparent by the six modes of cognition,</li>
<li>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en171"></a>impermanent,</li>
