<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs431"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, as the result of good karma having been wrought, having been stored up in connexion with the sensuous universe, visual cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness, and having as its object something seen, then there is</p>

<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs433"></a>What on that occasion is feeling?</strong></p>
<p>The mental [condition], neither pleasant nor unpleasant, which on that occasion is born of contact with the appropriate element of visual cognition; the sensation, born of contact with thought, which is neither easeful nor painful; the feeling, born of contact with thought, which is neither easeful nor painful—this is the feeling that there then is.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs434"></a>What on that occasion is perception?</strong></p>
<p>The perception, the perceiving, the state of having perceived, which on that occasion is born of contact with the appropriate element of visual cognition—this is the perception that there then is.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs435"></a>What on that occasion is thinking?</strong></p>
<p>The thinking, the cogitating, the reflection which on that occasion is born of contact with the appropriate element of visual cognition—this is the thinking that there then is.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs436"></a>What on that occasion is thought?</strong></p>
<p>The thought which on that occasion is ideation, mind, heart, that which is clear, ideation as the sphere of mind, the faculty of ideation, intellect, the skandha of intellect, the appropriate element of visual cognition—this is the thought that there then is.</p>

<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs498"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, as the result of good karma having been wrought, having been stored up in connexion with the sensuous universe, an element of representative cognition has arisen,</p>
<ol>
<li>accompanied by happiness and associated with knowledge …</li>
<li>accompanied by happiness, associated with knowledge, and prompted by a conscious motive …</li>
<li>accompanied by happiness and disconnected with knowledge …</li>
<li>accompanied by happiness, disconnected with knowledge, and prompted by a conscious motive …</li>
<li>accompanied by disinterestedness and associated with knowledge …</li>
<li>accompanied by disinterestedness, associated with knowledge, and prompted by a conscious motive …</li>
<li>accompanied by disinterestedness and disconnected with knowledge …</li>
<li>accompanied by disinterestedness, disconnected<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en136"></a>with knowledge, and prompted by a conscious motive, and having as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible, or what not, then there is contact … balance.</li>
</ol>
<p>These, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion—these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs498a"></a></strong></p>
<p>That absence of lust which is the root of indeterminateness … that absence of hate which is the root of indeterminateness … that absence of dullness which is the root of indeterminateness … these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<h2>2. In the universe of Form.</h2>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs499"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, that he may attain to the heavens of Form, he cultivates the way thereto, and aloof from sensuous appetites, etc., enters into and abides in the First Jhāna … then there is contact, etc. Now, these … are states that are good. But when, as the result of just this <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en137"></a>good karma having been wrought, having been stored up in connexion with the universe of Form, he, aloof from sensuous appetites, etc., enters into and abides in the First Jhāna … then there is contact, etc. And these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs500"></a>Repeat, substituting the formula of the remaining Jhānas on the Fourfold System, and of all the Jhānas on the Fivefold System.</p>
<h2>3. In the universe of the Formless.</h2>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs501"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, that he may attain to the heavens of the Formless, he cultivates the way thereto, and so, by passing wholly beyond all consciousness of form, by the dying out of the consciousness of sensory reaction, by turning the attention from any consciousness of the manifold, he enters into and abides in that frame of mind which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of unbounded space—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease must have been put away, etc. <span class="pe">continue as in §265</span>—then the contact … the balance that arises, these … are states that are good.</p>
<p>But when, as the result of just this good karma having been wrought, having been stored up in connexion with the universe of the Formless, he, by passing wholly beyond all consciousness of form, by the dying out of the consciousness of sensory reaction, by turning the attention from any consciousness of the manifold, enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of unbounded space—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease must have been put away, etc. <span class="pe">continue as above</span>… then the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en138"></a>contact … the balance that arises, these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs502-504"></a>Here follow in succession the other three ‘Jhānas connected with Formless Existence’ (§§266–268), namely, ‘the Sphere of Infinite Intellection’, ‘the Sphere of Nothingness’, and ‘the Sphere where there is neither Perception nor Non-perception’, each having the Fourth Jhāna as its ‘result’, as in the formula stated in §501.</p>
