</div>
<h2>(a) The Five Modes of Sense-Cognition</h2>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs556"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, as the result of bad karma having been wrought, having been stored up,</p>
<ul>
<li>visual cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a sight …</li>
<li>auditory cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a sound …</li>
<li>olfactory cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a smell …</li>
<li>gustatory cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a taste …</li>
<li>cognition of body has arisen, accompanied by distress and having as its object something tangible,</li>
</ul>
<p>then there is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en152"></a>contact</li>
<li>thinking,</li>
<li>feeling</li>
<li>thought,</li>
<li>perception, distress,</li>
<li>self-collectedness;</li>
<li>the faculties of ideation,</li>
<li>distress,</li>
<li>vitality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion—these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class="pe">Question and answer on ‘contact’ as above passim.<a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs557"></a></p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs558"></a>What on that occasion is feeling?</strong></p>
<p>The bodily pain, the bodily distress which, on that occasion, is born of contact with the appropriate element of cognition of body; the painful, distressful sensation which is born of contact with the body; the painful, distressful feeling which is born of contact with the body—this is the feeling that there then is.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs559"></a>What on that occasion is distress?</strong></p>
<p>The bodily pain, the bodily distress which, on that occasion, is the painful, distressful sensation born of contact with the body; the painful, distressful feeling born of contact with the body—this is the distress that there then is.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs560"></a>What on that occasion is the faculty of distress?</strong></p>
<p class="pe">Answer as in §559.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en153"></a>Or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion, these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs560a"></a></strong></p>
<p>Now at that time</p>
<ul>
<li>the skandhas are four,</li>
<li>the spheres are two,</li>
<li>the elements are two,</li>
<li>the nutriments are three,</li>
<li>the faculties are three,</li>
<li>contact,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="pe">Continue as in §58.</p>
<ul>
<li>the faculty of ideation counts as a single factor,</li>
<li>the element of the cognition of body counts as a single factor,</li>
<li>the sphere of [mental] states counts as a single factor,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="pe">Continue as in §§58–61.</p>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs561"></a>What on that occasion is the skandha of syntheses?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contact, discursive thought,</li>
<li>thinking, self-collectedness;</li>
<li>conception, the faculty of vitality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion, exclusive of the skandhas of feeling, perception and intellect—these are the skandha of syntheses.</p>
<p class="pe">Continue as in §63, etc.</p>
<h2>(b) The Element of Ideation</h2>
<p><strong><a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en154"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs562"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, as the result of bad karma having been wrought, having been stored up, an element of ideation has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness, and having as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible or what not, then there is</p>
<ul>
<li>contact, thought,</li>
<li>feeling, conception,</li>
<li>perception, discursive thought,</li>
<li>thinking, disinterestedness,</li>
<li>self-collectedness;</li>
<li>the faculties of ideation,</li>
<li>disinterestedness,</li>
<li>vitality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion—these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs562a"></a>This including the description of the appropriate skandha of syntheses <a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs563"></a>, is identical with the corresponding Summary, §§467a, 468.</p>
<h2>(c) The Element of Representative Intellection.</h2>
<p><strong><a class="pts-cs" id="pts-cs564"></a>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When, as the result of bad karma having been wrought, having been stored up, an element of representative intellection has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness, and having as its object a sight, etc., or what not, then there is</p>
<ul>
<li>contact, thought,</li>
<li>feeling</li>
<li>conception,</li>
<li>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en155"></a>perception, discursive thought,</li>
<li>thinking</li>
<li>self-collectedness;</li>
<li>the faculties of</li>
<li>ideation,</li>
<li>disinterestedness,</li>
<li>vitality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion—these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class="pe">Continue as in §§485–496.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p class="pe">This including the description of the appropriate skandha of syntheses, is identical with §§496a, 497.<strong>[564a, 565]</strong></p>
