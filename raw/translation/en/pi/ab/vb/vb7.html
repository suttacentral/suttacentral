<h3>7.1.2.  Explanation of the Contemplation of the Body</h3>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s356"></a>And how does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to himself?</p>
<p>Here a monk in regard to himself—from the sole of the feet upwards, from the hair of the head down, bounded by the skin, and filled with manifold impurities—reflects (thus): </p>
<p>There are in this body:</p>
<p>hairs of the head, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, mucus, <a class="ba" id="ba252"></a> synovial fluid, urine.</p>
<p>He practices, develops, makes much of that sign, and fixes its definition, and after he has practised, developed, made much of that sign, and fixed its definition, he focuses his mind on another’s body.<a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi194"></a></p>
<p>And how does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to another?</p>
<p>Here a monk in regard to another’s body—from the sole of the feet upwards, from the hair of the head down, bounded by the skin, and filled with manifold impurities—reflects (thus):</p>
<p>There are in his body:</p>
<p>hairs of the head, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, mucus, synovial fluid, urine.</p>
<p>He practices, develops, makes much of that sign, and fixes its definition, and after he has practised, developed, made much of that sign, and fixed its definition, he focuses his mind on his own and on another’s body.</p>
<p>And how does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to himself and in regard to another?</p>
<p>Here a monk in regard to himself and another—from the sole of the feet upwards, from the hair of the head down, bounded by the skin, and filled with manifold impurities—reflects (thus):</p>
<p>There are in the body:</p>
