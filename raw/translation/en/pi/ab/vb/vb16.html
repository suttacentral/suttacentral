<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s810"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is by way of cause, by way of root, of the resultant of past, future and present actions that are performed</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends thus; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by fortunate rebirth, do not mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by a fortunate body, do not mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by fortunate time, do not mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, prevented by fortunate effort, do not mature.</p>
<p>There are some bad actions performed, which, because of unfortunate rebirth, do mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, because of an unfortunate body, do mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, because of unfortunate time, do mature; there are some bad actions performed, which, because of unfortunate effort, do mature.</p>

This is the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is by way of cause, by way of root of the resultant of past, future and present actions that are performed. (2)</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s811"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the practice leading to all (destiny)</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends thus, “This is the path, this is the practice leading to hell”; he comprehends thus, “this is the path, this is the practice leading to the animal plane”; he comprehends thus, “this is the path, this is the practice leading to the ghost plane”; he comprehends thus, “this is the path, this is the practice leading to the human plane”; he comprehends thus, “this is the path, this is the practice leading to the god plane”; he comprehends thus, “this is the path; this is the practice leading to full emancipation”; that which therein is wisdom, understanding, <span class="add">See section <a class="cr" href="./vb12#pts-cs-525">525</a>.</span> absence of delusion, truth investigation, right view.

<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s812"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the world that has many elements, different elements</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends the different aggregates; he comprehends the different sense-bases; he comprehends the different elements; he comprehends the different worlds that have many elements, different elements; thus that which therein is wisdom, understanding, <span class="add">See section <a class="cr" href="./vb12#pts-cs-525">525</a>.</span> absence of delusion, truth investigation, right view. This is the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the world that has many elements, different elements. (4)</p>
<p><a class="ba" id="ba445"></a><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s813"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the different dispositions of beings</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends thus, “There are beings of inferior disposition; there are beings of superior disposition. Beings of inferior disposition depend on, approach, frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depend on, approach, frequent beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the past, too, beings of inferior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the future, too, beings of inferior disposition will depend on, will approach, will frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition will depend on, will approach, will frequent beings of superior disposition”. <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi340"></a> Thus that which therein is wisdom, understanding, <span class="add">See section <a class="cr" href="./vb12#pts-cs-525">525</a>.</span> absence of delusion, truth investigation, right view. This is the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the different dispositions of beings. (5)</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s814"></a>Therein what is “<span class="term">the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the improvement, of the deterioration of the faculty of other beings, of other persons</span>”? Herein the Tathāgata comprehends the inclination of beings; he comprehends the latent tendency; he comprehends characteristic action; he comprehends disposition; he comprehends beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties, with weak faculties, of skilful qualities, of unskilful qualities, easy to instruct, hard to instruct, fit or not fit.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s815"></a>And what is the <span class="term">inclination (of thought) of beings</span>? “The world is eternal” or “the world is not eternal”, “the world is finite” or “the world is infinite”, “vital principle and the body are the same” or “vital principle and the body are different”, “the Tathāgata exists after death” or “the Tathāgata does not exist after death” or “the Tathāgata exists and does not exist after death” or “the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death”, thus there are beings depending on existence views, depending on non-existence views. By not adhering to both these extremes, ability in conformity and<a class="ba" id="ba446"></a> knowledge as it really is in specific causality and dependently originated <i>dhammas</i> is gained. This is the inclination of beings.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s816"></a>And what is <span class="term">latent tendency of beings</span>? The seven latent tendencies are: Latent tendency to sensuous lust, latent tendency to repulsion, latent tendency to conceit, latent tendency to wrong view, latent tendency to doubt, latent tendency to lust for existence, latent tendency to ignorance. That which in the world is a lovely thing, pleasant thing, the tendency of beings to lust for that lies latent; that which in the world is an unlovely thing, unpleasant thing, the tendency of beings to repulsion for that lies latent. Thus in these two <i>dhammas</i> it should be understood that ignorance continuously occurs, and coupled therewith, conceit, wrong view and doubt. This is latent tendency of beings.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s817"></a>And what is the <span class="term">characteristic action of beings</span>? Activity producing skilful (resultant), activity producing unskilful (resultant), activity producing unshakeable (resultant), having low level or having high level.

There are beings of inferior disposition; there are beings of superior disposition; beings of inferior disposition depend on, <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi341"></a> approach, frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depend on, approach, frequent beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the past, too, beings of inferior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition depended on, approached, frequented beings of superior disposition.</p>
<p>In the future, too, beings of inferior disposition will depend on, will approach, will frequent beings of inferior disposition. Beings of superior disposition will depend on, will approach, will frequent beings of superior disposition. This is disposition of beings.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s819"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings with much dust in their eyes</span>?

Those beings who have bad inclinations, have bad latent tendencies, have bad characteristic actions, have bad dispositions, have much dust in their eyes, have weak faculties. These are those beings with unskilful qualities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s824"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings with skilful qualities</span>? Those beings who have sound inclinations, have sound characteristic actions, have sound dispositions, have little dust in their eyes, have sharp faculties. These are those beings with skilful qualities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-s" id="pts-s825"></a>Who are those <span class="term">beings hard to instruct</span>? Those beings who have unskilful qualities, they indeed are those beings hard to instruct. Those beings who have skilful qualities, they indeed are those beings easy to instruct.</p>

Those beings who are furnished with the obstruction of (unskilful) action, furnished with the obstruction of corruption, furnished with the obstruction of (unskilful) resultant, have no confidence, have no wish (to do skilful), have no wisdom (accompanying rebirth consciousness), are not fit to enter into the immutable rightness of skilful <i>dhammas</i> (i.e. path consciousness). These are those beings who are not fit. <a class="pts-p-pi" id="pts-p-pi342"></a></p>

Those beings who are not furnished with the obstruction of (unskilful) action, not furnished with the obstruction of corruption, not furnished with the obstruction of (unskilful) resultant, have confidence, have wish (to do skilful), have wisdom (accompanying rebirth consciousness), are fit to enter into the immutable Tightness of skilful <i>dhammas</i> (i.e. path consciousness). These are those beings who are fit; thus, that which therein is wisdom, understanding, <span class="add">See section <a class="cr" href="./vb12#pts-cs-525">525</a>.</span> absence of delusion, truth investigation, right view. This is the Tathāgata’s knowledge as it really is of the improvement, of the deterioration of the faculty of other beings, of other persons. (6)</p>
