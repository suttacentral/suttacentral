Herein there is work to be done by a monk; his (thought) is thus, “Indeed there will be work to be done by me, but when doing the work my body will become tired; well, I will lie down”. He lies down, does not arouse energy for the attaining of the unattained, for the obtaining of the unobtained, for the realizing of the unrealized. This is the first sense-base of laziness.</p>

<p>And again, the monk wandering through village or town for alms-food gets sufficient and adequate coarse or fine food, his (thought) is thus, “Indeed, I, wandering through village or town for alms-food received sufficient and adequate coarse or fine food, this body of mine became tired, not fit for work, like a soaked bean; well, I will lie down”. He lies down, does not arouse energy for the attaining of the unattained, for the obtaining of the unobtained, for the realizing of the unrealized. This is the sixth sense-base of laziness.</p>
<p>And again, there arises in the monk a trifling illness, his (thought) is thus, “This trifling illness has arisen in me, it is proper to lie down; well, I will lie down”.
