At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time incoming monks entered the
monastery with their sandals on, and they entered the monastery with sunshades
up, and they entered the monastery with their heads muffled up, and they
entered the monastery having put their robes on their heads, and they washed
their feet in the drinking water, and they did not greet the resident monks who
were senior nor ask about lodgings. And a certain incoming monk, having
unfastened the bolt of an unoccupied dwelling-place, having opened the door,
entered hastily. A snake fell on to his shoulder from a lintel above;
terrified, he uttered a cry of distress. Monks, having run up, spoke thus to
that monk: “Why did you, your reverence, utter a cry of distress?” Then this
monk told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks looked down
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these incoming monks enter
a monastery with their sandals on … nor ask about lodgings?” Then these monks
told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that incoming monks entered a monastery with
their sandals on … and did not ask about lodgings?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can incoming monks enter a monastery with their sandals on … nor
ask about lodgings? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.292" href="#BD.5.292"></a>
“Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for incoming monks which
should be observed by incoming monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.1.2" href="#Kd.18.1.2"></a>
“Monks, an incoming monk, thinking, ‘I will now enter a monastery,’
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.208" href="#Vin.2.208"></a>
having taken off his sandals, having put them down, having beaten them, having
taken them up (again), having lowered his sunshade, having uncovered his head,
having put his robe over his shoulder, should enter the monastery carefully and
unhurriedly. While he is entering the monastery, he should notice where the
resident monks have withdrawn to. Wherever resident monks have withdrawn
to—whether to an assembly hall or to a hut or to the root of a tree—having gone
there, he should put down his bowl at one side, he should put down his robe at
one side, and having taken a suitable seat he should sit down. He should ask
about the drinking water, he should ask about the washing water—which the
drinking water is, which the washing water. If he wants drinking water, having
taken drinking water he should drink; if he wants washing water, having taken
washing water he should wash his feet. When he is washing his feet he should
sprinkle water (over them) with one hand and wash his feet with the other; but
he should not sprinkle water and wash his feet with one and the same hand.
Having asked for a piece of cloth to wipe his sandals, he should wipe the
sandals. While he is wiping his sandals he should first wipe them with a dry
piece of cloth, afterwards with a damp one; having washed the pieces of cloth
for wiping the sandals he should spread them on one side. If a resident monk is
senior he should greet him; if he is newly ordained he should make him greet
(him). He should ask about lodgings, saying: ‘Which lodging pertains to me?’ He
should ask whether it is occupied or unoccupied. He should ask about resorts
for alms, he should ask about non-resorts for <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.293" href="#BD.5.293"></a>
alms, he should ask about the families which are agreed upon as learners, he
should ask about the privies, he should ask about the drinking water, he should
ask about the water for washing, he should ask about a staff, he should ask
about (the form of) the Order’s agreement, saying: ‘What time should it be
entered upon, what time should it be departed from?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.1.3" href="#Kd.18.1.3"></a>
“If the dwelling-place is unoccupied, having knocked at the door, having waited
a moment, having unfastened the bolt, having opened the door, he should watch
out while standing outside. If the dwelling-place is soiled or if couch is
piled on couch or if chair is piled on chair and lodgings heaped on top of
them, he should clear (the dwelling-place) if he is able to do so. While
clearing the dwelling place, having first taken out the ground covering he
should lay it to one side. Having taken out the supports for the beds … having
taken out the mattress and the squatting-mat … the piece of cloth to sit upon
and the sheet, he should lay them to one side. Having lowered the couch, having
taken it out carefully without rubbing it, without knocking it against the door
or the posts <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.209" href="#Vin.2.209"></a>
he should lay it to one side. Having lowered the chair, having taken it out
carefully without rubbing it, without knocking it against the door or the
posts, he should lay it to one side. Having taken out the spittoon, he should
lay it to one side. Having taken out the reclining board, he should lay it to
one side. If there are cobwebs in the dwelling-place, he should first remove
them from the (floor-) covering. He should wipe the corners of the
window-holes. If a wall that was coloured red becomes stained, he should wipe
it having moistened a rag, having wrung it out. If ground that was blacked
becomes stained, he should wipe it having moistened a rag, having wrung it out.
If the ground has not been treated, he should sweep it having sprinkled it all
over with <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.294" href="#BD.5.294"></a>
water, thinking: ‘Take care lest the dwelling-place is sullied with dust.’
Having looked for (any) rubbish, he should remove it to one side.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.1.4" href="#Kd.18.1.4"></a>
“Having dried the ground-covering in the sun, having cleaned it, having shaken
it, having brought it back, he should lay it down as it was before. Having
dried the supports for the couch in the sun, having wiped them, having brought
them back, he should place them as they were before. Having dried the couch in
the sun … the chair in the sun, having cleaned it, having shaken it, having
lowered it, having brought it back carefully without rubbing it, without
knocking it against the door or the posts, it should be laid down as it was
before. Having dried the mattress and the squatting mat in the sun, having
cleaned them, having shaken them, having brought them back, they should be laid
down as they were before. Having dried the piece of cloth to sit upon and the
sheet in the sun, having cleaned them, having shaken them, having brought them
back, they should be laid down as they were before. Having dried the spittoon
in the sun, having wiped it, having brought it back, it should be placed where
it was before. Having dried the reclining-board in the sun, having wiped it,
having brought it back, it should be placed where it was before.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.1.5" href="#Kd.18.1.5"></a>
“He should lay aside the bowl and robes. When laying aside the bowl, having
taken the bowl in one hand, having felt with the other under the couch or under
the chair, the bowl should be laid aside, but the bowl should not be laid aside
on the bare ground. When laying aside the robe, having taken the robe in one
hand, having stroked the other hand along the bamboo for robes or along the
cord for robes, having got the edges away from him and the fold towards him,
the robe should be laid aside.</p>
<p>“If dusty winds blow from the east, he should close the eastern windows. If
dusty winds blow from the west, he should close the western windows. If dusty
winds blow from the north, he should close the northern windows. If dusty winds
blow from the south, he should close the southern windows. If the weather is
cool, he should open the windows <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.295" href="#BD.5.295"></a>
by day, he should close them by night. If the weather is warm, he should close
the windows by day, he should open them by night.</p>
<p>“If a cell <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.210" href="#Vin.2.210"></a>
is soiled, the cell should be swept. If a porch is soiled, the porch should be
swept. If an attendance-hall … if a fire-hall … if a privy is soiled, the privy
should be swept. If there is no drinking water, drinking water should be
provided. If there is no water for washing, water for washing should be
provided. If there is no water in the pitcher of water for rinsing, water
should be tipped into the pitcher of water for rinsing. This, monks, is the
observance for incoming monks that is to be observed by incoming monks.”</p>
<h2>On the duties of residents</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.18.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.2.1" href="#Kd.18.2.1"></a>
Now at that time resident monks, having seen incoming monks, neither appointed
a seat nor brought forward water for the feet, a footstool, a footstand, nor,
having gone to meet them, did they receive their bowls and robes, they did not
offer drinking water, they did not greet the senior incoming monks, nor appoint
lodgings. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying: “How can these resident monks, having seen incoming monks,
neither appoint a seat … nor appoint lodgings?” Then these monks told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks …?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well now, monks, I will lay down an observance for resident monks that should
be observed by resident monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.2.2" href="#Kd.18.2.2"></a>
“Monks, when a resident monk has seen an incoming monk who is senior, he should
appoint a seat, he should bring forward water for the feet, a footstool, a
footstand, having gone to meet him he should receive his bowl and robe, he
should offer him drinking water, and if he is able he should wipe his sandals.
When he is wiping his sandals, he should first wipe them with a dry piece of
cloth, afterwards with a damp one; having washed the pieces of cloth for wiping
the sandals he should spread them on one side. An incoming monk should be
greeted and a lodging appointed with the words, ‘This lodging pertains <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.296" href="#BD.5.296"></a>
to you.’ He should explain whether it is occupied or unoccupied, the alms
resorts should be explained, the non-alms resorts … the families agreed upon as
learners … the privies … the drinking water … the washing water … the staff …
the form of the Order’s agreement should be explained with the words, ‘This is
the time to enter upon it, this is the time to depart from it.’ <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.211" href="#Vin.2.211"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.2.3" href="#Kd.18.2.3"></a>
“If it is a newly ordained monk (who is incoming) then (the resident one)
sitting down should explain: ‘Put aside your bowl in this place, put aside your
robe in this place, sit on this seat.’ The drinking water should be explained
(to him), the water for washing should be explained, the pieces of cloth for
wiping the sandals should be explained. And incoming monks should be made to
greet (him). The lodgings should be explained to him with the words, ‘This
lodging pertains to you.’ He should explain whether it is occupied or
unoccupied, alms resorts should be explained … (the form of) the Order’s
agreement should be explained with the words, ‘This is the time to enter upon
it, this is the time to depart from it.’ This, monks, is the observance for
resident monks that should be observed by resident monks.”</p>
<h2>On the duties of travellers</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.18.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.3.1" href="#Kd.18.3.1"></a>
Now at that time monks who were going away set out without having packed away
their wooden goods and clay goods, having opened the doors and windows, and
without having asked (for permission) as to their lodgings. The wooden goods
and the clay goods were lost and the lodgings came to be unguarded. Those who
were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can these monks who are going
away set out … lodgings came to be unguarded?” Then these monks told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for monks who are going away
and which should be observed by monks who are going away.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.3.2" href="#Kd.18.3.2"></a>
“Monks, when a monk is going away, having packed away his wooden goods, his
clay goods, having closed the doors and windows, he may set out having asked
(for permission) as to his lodgings. If there is no monk, he should ask a
novice <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.297" href="#BD.5.297"></a>
(for permission). If there is no novice, he should ask a monastery attendant
(for permission). If there is no monk or novice or monastery attendant, having
laid a couch down on four stones, having piled couch on couch, having piled
chair on chair, having made the lodgings into a heap on top (of them), he may
set out having packed away the wooden goods the clay goods, having closed the
doors and windows.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.3.3" href="#Kd.18.3.3"></a>
“If the dwelling-place is leaking he should roof it if he is able to do so, or
he should make an effort, thinking, ‘How then can this dwelling-place be
roofed?’ If he thus succeeds in this, that is good, but if he does not succeed,
having laid down a couch on four stones in a place where it is not leaking,
having piled couch on couch, having piled chair on chair, having made the
lodgings into a heap on top (of them), he may set out, having packed away his
wooden goods, his clay goods, having closed the doors and windows. If the whole
dwelling-place is leaking, if he is able he should convey the lodgings to a
village, or he should make an effort, thinking, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.212" href="#Vin.2.212"></a>
‘How then can this lodging be conveyed to a village?’ If he thus succeeds in
this, that is good. If he does not succeed, having laid a couch down on four
stones in the open air, having piled couch on couch, having piled chair on
chair, having made the lodgings into a heap on top (of them), having packed
away his wooden goods, his clay goods, having covered them with grass or
leaves, he may set out, thinking, ‘So can the different things surely remain.’
This, monks, is the observance for monks who are going away and which should be
observed by monks who are going away.”</p>
<h2>On the duties of expressing appreciation</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.18.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.4.1" href="#Kd.18.4.1"></a>
Now at that time monks did not give thanks in a refectory. People looked down
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, not give thanks in a refectory?” Monks heard these people who … spread
it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.298" href="#BD.5.298"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give thanks in a refectory.</span>” Then it occurred to the monks: “Now, by whom should thanks be given in a
refectory?” They told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion,
having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give thanks in a refectory through a monk who is an
elder.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time a certain guild had food for an Order; the venerable Sāriputta
was the elder in the Order. Monks, thinking, ‘The Lord has allowed thanks to be
given in a refectory through a monk who is an elder,’ departed, leaving the
venerable Sāriputta alone. Then the venerable Sāriputta, having returned thanks
to these people, later went away alone. The Lord saw the venerable Sāriputta
coming in the distance; seeing him, he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:
“I hope, Sāriputta, that the meal was successful?”</p>
<p>“The meal, Lord, was successful, even though the monks departed leaving me
alone.” Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed
the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, four or five monks who are elders or next (in age) to the
elders to wait in a refectory.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time a certain elder waited in a refectory although he wanted to
relieve himself, and through restraining himself he fell down fainting. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, if there is a reason, to go away, having asked (permission
from) the monk immediately next (to you).</span>”</p>
<h2>On duties in the refectory</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.4.2" href="#Kd.18.4.2"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.213" href="#Vin.2.213"></a>
improperly attired, went into a refectory and turning aside went in close in
front of monks who were elders, and sat down encroaching on (the space intended
for) the elders and kept newly ordained monks from a seat and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.299" href="#BD.5.299"></a>
sat down amid the houses having spread out their outer cloaks. Those who were
modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the group of six monks,
wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, improperly attired, go into a refectory … sit
down encroaching on … and sit down amid the houses haying spread out their
outer cloaks?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks, wrongly dressed …
having spread out their outer cloaks?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, I will lay down a refectory observance for monks and which
should be observed by monks in a refectory.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.4.3" href="#Kd.18.4.3"></a>
“If the time is announced in a monastery, (a monk), having dressed with the
inner robe all round him for covering the three circles, having tied on his
waistband, having made one bundle, having clothed himself in his upper robes,
having fastened the block, having washed, having taken a bowl, he may enter a
village carefully and unhurriedly. He should not, turning aside, go in close in
front of monks who are elders, he should go (sit down) amid the houses properly
clad, well controlled should he go (sit down) amid the houses, with eyes cast
down should he go (sit down) amid the houses, not lifting up the robes … not
with loud laughter … with little noise … not swaying the body … not swaying the
arms … not swaying the head … not with the arms akimbo … not muffled up should
he go (sit down) amid the houses, he should not go amid the houses crouching
down on his heels, he should not go amid the houses lolling, he should not sit
down amid the houses encroaching (on the space intended) for monks who are
elders, newly ordained monks should not be kept from a seat, he should not sit
down amid the houses having spread out his outer cloak.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.4.4" href="#Kd.18.4.4"></a>
“When water is being given out, having grasped the bowl
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.300" href="#BD.5.300"></a>
with both hands, the water should be received I having put it down carefully
the bowl should be washed without rubbing it. If there is a receiver of (used)
water, having put the bowl down, the water should be sprinkled into a waste-tub
thinking, ‘Be careful not to splash the receiver of (used) water with the
water, not to splash the neighbouring monks with the water, not to splash the
outer cloak with water.’ If <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.214" href="#Vin.2.214"></a>
there is no receiver of (used) water, having put down the bowl, the water
should be sprinkled on to the ground, thinking, ‘Be careful not to splash the
neighbouring monks with water nor to splash the outer cloak with water.’ If
cooked rice is being given, having grasped the bowl with both hands, the cooked
rice should be received. Room should be left for the curry. If there is ghee or
oil or tit-bits an elder should say: ‘Obtain the same for all.’ Almsfood should
be received attentively … thinking of the bowl … with equal curry, almsfood
should be received at an equal level. The elder should not eat until the cooked
rice has been served to all.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.4.5" href="#Kd.18.4.5"></a>
“Almsfood should be eaten attentively … thinking of the bowl … on continuous
almsround … with equal curry … not having chosen from the top; neither the
curry nor the condiment should be covered up with cooked rice, (the monk)
desiring something more; neither the curry nor the cooked rice should be eaten
by one who is not ill having asked for it for himself; others’ bowls should not
be looked at captious-mindedly; too large a mouthful should not be made up;
pieces (of food) should be made up into a round; the door of the face should
not be opened if the mouthful is not brought close; while eating, the whole
hand should not be put into the mouth; one should not talk with a mouthful in
the mouth; one should not eat tossing up balls (of food); one should not eat
breaking up the mouthfuls … stuffing the cheeks … shaking the hands about …
scattering <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.301" href="#BD.5.301"></a>
lumps of boiled rice … putting out the tongue … smacking the lips … making a
hissing sound … licking the fingers … licking the bowl … licking the lips, one
should not accept a drinking cup with a hand (soiled) with food.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.4.6" href="#Kd.18.4.6"></a>
“An elder should not accept water until everyone has eaten. When the water is
being given, having grasped the bowl in both hands … ‘… nor to splash the outer
cloak with water.’ One should not throw out amidst the houses rinsings of the
bowl with lumps of boiled rice. When they are returning, newly ordained monks
should return first, afterwards <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.215" href="#Vin.2.215"></a>
the elders. One should go properly clad amid the houses, well controlled should
one go amid the houses … … one should not go amid the houses crouching down on
the heels. This, monks, is the refectory observance for monks and which monks
should observe in a refectory.”</p>
<p class="end">The First Portion for Repeating.</p>
<h2>On duties for those going on almsround</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.18.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.5.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.5.1" href="#Kd.18.5.1"></a>
Now at that time monks who walked for almsfood walked for almsfood wrongly
dressed, wrongly clothed, improperly attired, and they entered a dwelling
without deliberation and they left without deliberation, and they entered very
hastily and they left very hastily, and they stood too far away and they stood
too close, and they stood too long and they turned away too soon. And a certain
monk who was walking for almsfood entered a dwelling without deliberation;
taking (a doorway) for the house-door, he entered an inner chamber. In that
inner chamber a woman was lying naked on her back. That monk saw that woman
lying naked on her back; seeing her, he thought: “This is not the house-door,
this is an inner chamber,” and he went away from that inner chamber. That
woman’s husband saw that woman lying naked on her back: seeing her, he thought:
“My wife has been seduced by that monk,” and having seized that monk, he
thrashed him. Then that woman, waking up at the noise, spoke thus <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.302" href="#BD.5.302"></a>
to that man: “Why are you, master, thrashing this monk?”</p>
<p>“You were seduced by this monk.”</p>
<p>“I was not, master, seduced by this monk. This monk is innocent,” and she made
him let go of that monk. Then that monk, having gone back to the monastery,
told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these monks who walk for almsfood
walk for almsfood wrongly dressed … enter … depart … stand … and turn away too
soon?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Is it true, as
is said, monks …?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for monks when they are
walking for almsfood and which should be observed by monks when they are
walking for almsfood.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.5.2" href="#Kd.18.5.2"></a>
“Monks, if a monk when he is walking for almsfood thinks: ‘I will enter this
village,’ having dressed himself with his inner robe all round him so as to
cover the three circles, having fastened his waistband, having made one bundle,
having clothed himself in his upper robes, having fastened the block, having
washed, having taken a bowl, he may enter the village carefully and
unhurriedly. He should go amid the houses properly clad <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.216" href="#Vin.2.216"></a>
… he should not go amid the houses crouching down on his heels. When he is
going amid the houses he should consider: ‘I will enter in this (fashion), I
will leave in this.’ He should not enter too hastily, he should not leave too
hastily, he should not stand too far away, he should not stand too close, he
should not stand too long, he should not turn away too soon. While he is
standing, he should consider: ‘Are they willing to give alms or are they not
willing?’ If she puts aside her work or rises from her seat or wipes a spoon or
wipes a dish or sets it out, he should stand still, thinking: ‘It is as though
she is willing to give.’ When alms are being given, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.303" href="#BD.5.303"></a>
having raised the outer cloak with the left hand, having uncovered the bowl
with the right hand, having grasped the bowl with both hands, the alms should
be received, but one should not look at the face of the donor of the alms. He
should consider: ‘Are they willing to give curry or are they not willing?’ If
she wipes a spoon or wipes a dish or sets it out, he should stand still,
thinking: ‘It is as though she is willing to give’. When the alms have been
given, having covered the bowl with the outer cloak, one should turn away
carefully and unhurriedly. One should go amid the houses properly clad … one
should not go amid the houses crouching down on one’s heels.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.5.3" href="#Kd.18.5.3"></a>
“Whoever returns first from the village for almsfood should make ready a seat,
he should bring forward water for (washing) the feet, a footstool, a footstand,
he should set out a refuse bowl, having washed it, he should set out drinking
water and water for washing. Whoever should return last from the village for
almsfood, if there should be the remains of a meal and if he should so desire,
he may eat them; but if he should not so desire, he may throw them away where
there is but little green grass or he may drop them into water where there are
no living creatures. He should put up the seat, he should put away the water

refuse-bowl, having washed it, he should put away the drinking water and the
water for washing, he should sweep the refectory. Whoever should see a vessel
for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a vessel (for water) for
rinsing after evacuation, void and empty, should set out (water). If it is
impossible for him (to do this) he should set out (water) by signalling with
his hand, having invited a companion (to help him) by a movement of his hand;
but he should not for such a reason break into speech. This, monks, is the
observance for monks when they are walking for almsfood and which should be
observed by monks when they are walking for almsfood.”</p>
<h2>On duties for forest dwellers</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.18.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.6.1" href="#Kd.18.6.1"></a>
Now at that time several monks were living in a forest.
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.304" href="#BD.5.304"></a>
They neither set out drinking water, nor did they set out water for washing,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.217" href="#Vin.2.217"></a>
nor did they set out a fire, nor did they set out kindling wood, they did not
know the positions of the lunar mansions, they did not know the divisions of
the quarters. Thieves, having gone there, spoke thus to these monks: “Is there
drinking water, honoured sirs?”</p>
<p>“There is not, friends.”</p>
<p>“Is there water for washing … Is there a fire … Is there kindling wood,
honoured sirs?”</p>
<p>“There is not, friends.”</p>
<p>“What is there a conjunction with today, honoured sirs?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, we do not know, friends.”</p>
<p>“Which quarter is this, honoured sirs?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, we do not know, friends.” Then these thieves thought: ‘These have no
drinking water nor water for washing, there is no fire, there is no kindling
wood, they do not know the positions of the lunar mansions, they do not know
the divisions of the quarters. These are thieves, these are not monks,’ and
having thrashed them, they departed. Then these monks told this matter to the
monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion,
having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for monks who are
forest-dwellers and which should be observed by monks who are forest-dwellers.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.6.2" href="#Kd.18.6.2"></a>
“Monks, a monk who is a forest-dweller, getting up early, having placed his
bowl in a bag, having hung it on his shoulder, having arranged his robe over
his shoulder, having put on his sandals, having packed away the wooden goods,
the clay goods, having closed the doors and windows, may leave his lodgings. If
he thinks: ‘Now I will enter a village,’ having taken off his sandals, having
put them down, having beaten them, having placed them in a bag, having hung it
on his shoulder, having dressed himself all round covering the three circles,
having fastened his waistband … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd18#Kd.18.5.2">Kd.18.5.2</a></span> … he
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.305" href="#BD.5.305"></a>
should turn away carefully and unhurriedly. He should go amid the houses
properly clad … he should not go amid the houses crouching down on his heels.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.18.6.3" href="#Kd.18.6.3"></a>
“Having set out from the village, having placed his bowl in the bag, having
hung it on his shoulder, having rolled up his robe, having placed it on his
head, having put on his sandals, he should go along. Monks, a monk who is a
forest-dweller should set out drinking water, he should set out water for
washing, he should set out a fire, he should set out kindling wood, he should
set out a walking staff, he should learn the positions of the lunar mansions,
either the whole or one part, he should become skilled in the quarters. This,
monks, is the observance for monks who are forest-dwellers and which should be
observed by monks who are forest-dwellers.”</p>

Now at that time several monks were
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.218" href="#Vin.2.218"></a>
making robes in the open air. The group of six monks beat their lodgings to
windward (of them) and in the open space; the monks were covered with dust.
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying: “How can this group of six monks beat their lodgings … so that monks
are covered with dust?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks beat their lodgings
… covered with dust?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he

Now at that time the group of six monks, being hindered in (their use of a)
bathroom by monks who were elders, having brought, out of disrespect, a
quantity of sticks, having made a fire, having closed the doorway, sat down in
the doorway. The monks, overcome by the heat, not being able to get through the
doorway, fell down fainting. Those who were modest monks … spread it about,
saying: “How can this group of six monks, being hindered (in their use of a)

newly ordained monks be turned away from a seat. If one is able, a treatment
should be done in the bathroom for monks who are elders. On leaving the
bathroom, having taken the chair for the bathroom and having covered oneself
front and back, one may leave the bathroom. If one is able, a treatment should

Now at that time a certain monk who had been born a brahmin, having relieved
himself, did not want to rinse, thinking: “Who would touch this foul evil
smell?” A worm remained in his rectum. Then this monk told this matter to the
monks. They said: “But did you, your reverence, not rinse after relieving
yourself?” “No, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about
… Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Is it true, as is

Now at that time monks relieved themselves in the privy according to seniority.
Newly ordained monks, having arrived first, waited and through restraining
themselves, they fell down fainting. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “Is it true, as is said, monks?” “It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them,

Now at that time the group of six monks entered a privy very hastily and they
entered forcibly and they relieved themselves while groaning and while chewing
toothwood and outside the proper vessels and they spat into a vessel and they
scraped themselves with a rough piece of wood and they dropped a piece of wood
for scraping into a cesspool; and they left very hastily and they left forcibly

Now at that time those who shared cells did not conduct themselves properly
towards their preceptors. Those who were modest monks … spread it about,
saying: “How can these who share cells not conduct themselves properly towards

robe over one shoulder, he should give toothwood, he should give water for
rinsing the mouth, he should make ready a seat. If there is conjey, having
washed a bowl, the conjey should be placed near (the preceptor). When he has

Now at that time preceptors did not conduct themselves properly towards those
who shared their cells. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:
“How can these preceptors not conduct themselves properly towards those who
share their cells?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Is
it true, as is said, monks, that preceptors do not conduct themselves properly
towards those who share their cells?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying: “Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance
for preceptors towards those who share their cells and which should be observed
by preceptors towards those who share their cells.</p>

be furthered, he should be helped by the preceptor in regard <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.318" href="#BD.5.318"></a>
to recitation, interrogation, exhortation, instruction. If there is a bowl for
the preceptor but no bowl for the one who shares his cell, a bowl should be
given by the preceptor to the one who shares his cell, or he should make an
effort, thinking: ‘How then could a bowl be procured for the one who shares my
cell?’ If there is a robe for the preceptor … if there is (another) requisite

short time in the sun’s warmth, but a robe should not be laid aside in the
warmth. He should fold up the robe. When folding up the robe, having made the
corners turn back four finger-breadths, he should fold up the robe, thinking:
‘Mind there is no crease in the middle’. The waistband should be placed in a
fold (of the robe). If there is almsfood and the one who shares a cell wishes

laying aside a robe, having taken the robe in one hand, having stroked the
other hand along the bamboo for robes or the cord for robes, having got the
edges away from him and the fold towards him, the robe should be laid aside.

<h5>In this Section are fifty-five items, fourteen observances. This is its key:</h5>
<p>With sandals and sunshades, heads muffled up, drinking water,

did not greet, they did not ask, snake, the well behaved looked down upon, /<br>
He took off, sunshade, and over his shoulder, and unhurriedly, withdrawal,<br>
laying aside bowl and robe, and suitable, asked, /<br>
Should sprinkle, and about washing, sandals with a dry and a damp (cloth),<br>
a senior, a newly ordained one should ask, and whether occupied, resorts, /<br>
Learners, privies, drinking water, washing, staff, agreement, thereupon<br>
the time, a moment, soiled, the ground-covering should be taken out, /<br>
Supports, mattress and squatting mat, and couch and chair, spittoon,<br>
reclining board, cobwebs, corners, coloured red, black, not treated, /<br>
And rubbish, ground covering, supports, couch and chair, <br>
mattress, piece of cloth to sit upon, spittoon, and reclining board, /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.322" href="#BD.5.322"></a>
Bowl and robe, and the ground, the edges away, the folds towards,<br>
from East, and from West, from the North, then from the South, /<br>
And cool, warm, by day, at night, and a cell, a porch,<br>
attendance- and fire-hall, and the custom in privies, /<br>
Water for drinking, for washing, and into pitchers of water for rinsing—<br>
For the rhythm: an observance laid down for those incoming. /<br>
Neither a seat, nor water, nor meeting, nor drinking water either,<br>
they did not greet, they did not appoint, and the well behaved spread it about.
/<br>
And a seat for a senior, water, and having gone to meet, drinking water,<br>
sandals, on one side, and he should be greeted, should be appointed, /
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.232" href="#Vin.2.232"></a>
<br>
Occupied, resorts and a learner, privy, drinking- and washing-water,<br>
staff, agreement, the time, if he is sitting down before one newly ordained, /
<br>
He should greet, he should explain, the method is as below.<br>
The observance for these resident ones was pointed out by the Leader of the
Caravan. /<br>
Those going away and wood, clay, having opened, not asking (for permission),<br>
and they were lost, and unguarded, and the well behaved ones looked down upon.
/ <br>
Having packed away, having closed, having asked (for permission), so may he set
out, <br>
monk or novice or park-attendant or lay follower, /<br>
On stones, a heap, he should pack away, and he should close,<br>
if he is able, or an effort, and just where it does not leak, / <br>
If the whole leaks—to a village, and just there in the open air,<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.323" href="#BD.5.323"></a>
“So the different things surely remain”: the observance for monks who are going
away. /<br>
They did not give thanks, through an elder, leaving alone, about four or five,<br>
wanting to relieve himself, he was fainting: these are the observances for
those giving thanks. /<br>
The group of six monks wrongly dressed and further wrongly clothed,<br>
and improperly, turning aside, encroaching on (the space intended for) elders,
/ <br>
And newly ordained monks, outer cloaks, and the well behaved looked down upon,<br>
having dressed with the inner robe all round one for covering the three
circles, waistband, one bundle, block, /<br>
Not turning aside, properly clad, well-controlled, eyes cast down,<br>
lifting up the robes, with loud laughter, noise, and so the three swayings, /<br>
Arms akimbo, muffled up, crouching, properly clad, well controlled,<br>
lifting up the robes, loud laughter, little noise, the three swayings, /<br>
Arms akimbo, muffled up, and lolling, encroaching, not on a seat,<br>
having spared (he should) not, when water, having lowered, he should not
splash, /<br>
Receiver, neighbouring, outer cloak, and if cooked rice it should be received,<br>
curry, tit-bits, for all, and an equal level, / <br>
Attentively, and thinking of the bowl, and on continuous almsround, equal
curry,<br>
not from the top, coverings up, asking, captious-mindedly, /<br>
Large, a round, door, whole hand, one should not talk,

ball, breaking up, cheeks, shaking, scattering lumps of boiled rice, /<br>
And then putting out the tongue, smacking the lips, making a hissing sound,<br>
licking the fingers, the bowl, the lips, accepting with what is soiled, /<br>
Until everyone, when water, having lowered, he should not splash,<br>
receiver, neighbouring, outer cloak, and having lowered on the ground, /<br>
With lumps of boiled rice, when returning, properly clad, crouching;<br>
this refectory-observance was laid down by the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-king. /<br>
Wrongly dressed, improperly, and without deliberation, hastily,<br>
far, close, long, soon, here just those who walk for alms. /

He may go properly clad, well controlled, his eyes cast down,<br>
lifting up the robes, with loud laughter, noise, and so the three swayings, /<br>
Arms akimbo, muffled up, crouching, and having considered, hastily,<br>
far, close, long, soon, a little seat, a spoon, /<br>
Or a dish and if she sets it out, having raised (and) having uncovered,<br>
(the alms) may be received, he should not look at, and that is about curries as
before, /<br>
A monk should cover with the outer cloak, he should go properly clad,<br>
well controlled, and the eyes cast down, lifting up the robes, and with loud
laughter, /<br>
Little noise, the three swayings, arms akimbo, muffled up, crouching,<br>

He should put away, he should sweep, if empty (and) depleted he should attend
(to them)<br>
by a sign with the hand, he should not break into: and the observance for those
who walk for alms. / <br>
Drinking water, washing water, fire, kindling wood and lunar mansions (and)
quarters (and) thieves,<br>
thinking, “there is nothing” having thrashed (them), a bowl, on the shoulder,
then the robe, / <br>
“Now,” having hung on the shoulder, the three circles, all round,<br>
as is the observance for those who walk for alms so are the meanings in that
for forest-dwellers. /<br>
A bowl, on the shoulder, robe, on the head, and having put on, drinking water,

washing water, fire, and also kindling wood, a staff, /<br>
Lunar mansions, or their positions, he should become skilled in the quarters:<br>
the observance was laid down for these forest-dwellers by the Best of Teachers.

robe, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.235" href="#Vin.2.235"></a>
<br>
from the East, and from the West, from the North, and then from the South, / <br>
And cool and warm, by day and night, and a cell, porch, <br>
attendance- and fire-hall, privy, drinking water, water for washing, /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.328" href="#BD.5.328"></a>
Pitcher of water for rinsing, dissatisfaction remorse, and wrong view,
important (rule),<br>
the beginning, <i lang="pi">mānatta</i>, rehabilitation, censure, guidance, /<br>
Banishment, reconciliation, and suspension, if it is carried out,<br>
he should wash, and he should make up, the dye, he should dye, turning it, / <br>
And bowl, and also robe, and a requisite, cutting off,<br>
service, commission, attendant, almsfood, entering, / <br>
Nor to a cemetery, and also from a district, he should attend him for as long
as life lasts;<br>
this is the observance for one who shares a cell. These are for a preceptor: /<br>
Exhortation, instruction, recitation, interrogation, and bowl, robe,<br>
and requisite, ill, he should not be an attendant. / <br>
These observances for preceptors are also so for teachers;<br>
as are the observances for those who share a cell, so they are for pupils. /<br>
Those observances for incoming ones, and again for resident ones,<br>
those going away, those giving thanks, in a refectory, those walking for
almsfood, / <br>
That observance for forest-dwellers, and also that for lodgings,<br>
In a bathroom, a privy, and those for preceptors and those who share their
cells, / <br>
(As is) that observance for teachers, so is it for pupils.<br>
Nineteen matters are spoken of in sixteen sections. /<br>
Being imperfect in observance one does not perfect morality, <br>
Impure in morality, of poor wisdom, one knows not one-pointedness of mind, / <br>
The mind wavering, not one-pointed, sees not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> rightly,<br>
not seeing true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, one is not freed from ill. /<br>
Being perfect in observance, one perfects morality too, <br>
pure in morality, with wisdom, one knows too one-pointedness of mind, /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.329" href="#BD.5.329"></a>
The mind unwavering, one-pointed, rightly sees <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> too,<br>
beholding true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, one is freed from ill. /<br>
Wherefore the watchful son of the Conqueror should fulfil the observance,<br>
the exhortation of the best of Buddhas—hence he will come to <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>. /
