<h2>The story of the monk Kassapagotta</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.9.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.1" href="#Kd.9.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.446" href="#BD.4.446"></a>
At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Campā on the bank of the
Gaggarā lotus-pool. Now at that time in the Kāsi country there was a village
named Vāsabha; a monk called Kassapagotta was a resident there, he was attached
to the tradition, he had made an effort so that well behaved monks who had not
come should come, and so that well behaved monks who had come should live in
comfort, and so that that residence should attain growth, expansion, maturity.
Now at that time several monks walking on tour among the Kāsi people arrived at
the village of Vāsabha. The monk Kassapagotta saw these monks coming in the
distance; seeing them he made ready a seat, he put out water for washing the
feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand, having gone out to meet them he received
their bowls and robes, he offered them drinking water, he made an effort in the
matter of bathing (for them), he also made an effort in the matter of conjey,
solid food, rice. Then it occurred to these incoming monks: “Good indeed is
this resident monk, your reverences, he makes an effort in the matter of
bathing (for us), he also makes an effort in the matter of conjey, solid food,
rice (for us). Come now, let us, your reverences, settle down just here at
Vāsabha <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.447" href="#BD.4.447"></a>
village.” Then these incoming monks settled down just there at Vāsabha
village.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.2" href="#Kd.9.1.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the monk Kassapagotta: “What was travel-weariness in these
incoming monks has abated; further they, who did not know which alms-resorts
were appointed, now know these alms-resorts which were appointed. It is indeed
arduous to make an effort all one’s life among strangers, and hinting is not
liked by the people. Suppose I were to make no effort in the matter of conjey,
solid food, rice?” He made no effort in the matter of conjey, solid food, rice.
Then it occurred to those incoming monks: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.313" href="#Vin.1.313"></a></p>
<p>“Formerly, your reverences, this resident monk made an effort in the matter of
bathing (for us), he also made an effort in the matter of conjey, solid food,
rice (for us), but now he makes no effort in the matter of conjey, solid food,
rice (for us). This resident monk, your reverences, is now corrupt. Come now,
your reverences, let us suspend the resident monk.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.3" href="#Kd.9.1.3"></a>
Then these incoming monks, having assembled together, spoke thus to the monk
Kassapagotta: “Now, formerly you, your reverence, used to make an effort in the
matter of bathing (for us), you also used to make an effort in the matter of
conjey, solid food, rice (for us), but now you make no effort in the matter of
conjey, solid food, rice (for us). You, your reverence, have fallen into an
offence; do you see this offence?”</p>
<p>“There is no offence of mine, your reverences, that I can see.”</p>
<p>Then these incoming monks suspended the monk Kassapagotta for not seeing the
offence. Then it occurred to the monk Kassapagotta: “Indeed I do not know this:
whether this is an offence or is no offence, and whether I have fallen or have
not fallen, and whether I am suspended or am not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.448" href="#BD.4.448"></a>
suspended, or whether it is by (an act) that is legitimate or that is not
legitimate, or by (one) that is reversible or that is irreversible, or by (one)
that is fit to stand or that is not fit to stand. Suppose that I, having gone
to Campā, were to ask the Lord about this matter?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.4" href="#Kd.9.1.4"></a>
Then the monk Kassapagotta, having packed away his lodging, taking his bowl and
robe, set out for Campā; in due course he approached Campā and the Lord. Having
approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Now
it is the custom for awakened ones, for lords to exchange friendly greetings
with incoming monks. So the Lord spoke thus to the monk Kassapagotta: “I hope,
monk, that things went well with you, I hope you had enough to support life, I
hope you have come on the journey with but little fatigue. But where, monk,
have you come from?”</p>
<p>“Things did go well with me, Lord, I had enough to support life, Lord, and I,
Lord, came on the journey with but little fatigue.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.5" href="#Kd.9.1.5"></a>
“There is, Lord, in the Kāsi country a village called Vāsabha. I, Lord, a
resident there, attached to the tradition, had made an effort so that well
behaved monks who had not come should come, and so that well behaved monks who
had come should live in comfort, and so that that residence should attain
growth, expansion, maturity. Then, Lord, several monks walking on tour among
the people of Kāsi arrived at the village of Vāsabha. I, Lord, saw those monks
coming in the distance; seeing them I made ready a seat … Then, Lord, it
occurred to these incoming monks: ‘Good indeed is this resident monk …’ <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.314" href="#Vin.1.314"></a>
… Then, Lord, these incoming monks settled down, just there in Vāsabha village.
Then, Lord, it occurred to me: ‘… Suppose I were to make no effort in … the
matter of conjey, solid food, rice (for them)?’ So then I made no effort …
Then, Lord, these incoming monks, having assembled together, spoke thus to me:
‘Now, formerly, your reverence … Do you see this offence?’ Then, Lord, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.449" href="#BD.4.449"></a>
these incoming monks suspended me for not seeing the offence. Then, Lord, it
occurred to me: ‘Indeed I do not know … Suppose that I, having gone to Campā,
were to ask the Lord about this matter?’ That is why, Lord, I have come.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.6" href="#Kd.9.1.6"></a>
“This is no offence, monk, this is not an offence; you are unfallen, you have
not fallen; you are unsuspended, you were not suspended; you were suspended by
a (formal) act that was not legitimate, that was reversible, that was not fit
to stand. Go you, monk, settle down there at Vāsabha village.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and the monk Kassapagotta having answered the Lord in
assent, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, keeping his right side
towards him, set out for Vāsabha village.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.7" href="#Kd.9.1.7"></a>
Then these incoming monks became doubtful, they became remorseful. They
thought: “Indeed it was unprofitable for us, indeed it was not profitable for
us, indeed it was ill-gotten by us, indeed it was not well-gotten by us, that
we suspended a pure monk, not an offender, without cause, without reason. Come
now, your reverences, having gone to Campā, let us confess the transgression as
a transgression to the Lord.” Then these incoming monks, having packed away
their lodgings, taking their bowls and robes, set out for Campā; in due course
they approached Campā and the Lord. Having approached, having greeted the Lord,
they sat down at a respectful distance. Now it is the custom for awakened ones,
for lords to exchange friendly greetings with incoming monks. So the Lord spoke
thus to those monks: “I hope, monks, that things went well with you, I hope you
had enough to support life, I hope you have come on the journey with but little
fatigue. But where, monks, have you come from?”</p>
<p>“Things have gone well with us, Lord, we had enough to support life, Lord, and
we came on the journey. Lord, with but little fatigue. There is, Lord, in the
Kāsi country a village called Vāsabha. We come from there, Lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.8" href="#Kd.9.1.8"></a>
“Did you, monks, suspend a resident monk?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord.”</p>
<p>“For what cause, monks, for what reason?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.450" href="#BD.4.450"></a>
“There was no cause, Lord, no reason.” The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them,
saying:</p>
<p>“It is not fitting, monks, it is not becoming <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.315" href="#Vin.1.315"></a>
, it is not suitable, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is
not to be done. How can you, foolish men, suspend a pure monk, not an offender,
without cause, without reason? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased …” and having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk,
he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, a pure monk, not an offender, is not to be suspended without cause,
without reason. Whoever should suspend one, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.1.9" href="#Kd.9.1.9"></a>
Then these monks, rising from their seats, having arranged their upper robes
over one shoulder, having inclined their heads towards the Lord’s feet, spoke
thus to the Lord: “Lord, a transgression has overcome us, in that we, foolish,
misguided, wrong that we were, suspended a pure monk, not an offender, without
cause, without reason. Lord, let the Lord acknowledge our transgression as a
transgression for the sake of restraint in the future.”</p>
<p>“Truly, monks, a transgression has overcome you, in that you, foolish,
misguided, wrong that you were, suspended a pure monk, not an offender, without
cause, without reason. But if you, monks, having seen the transgression as a
transgression, confess according to the rule, we acknowledge it for you; for,
monks, in the discipline for an <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> this is growth: whoever having seen a transgression as a transgression
confesses it according to the rule, he attains restraint in the future.”</p>
<h2>On an act not by rule in an incomplete assembly, etc.</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.9.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.2.1" href="#Kd.9.2.1"></a>
Now at that time at Campā monks carried out (formal) acts like these: they
carried out a (formal) act not by rule, in an incomplete assembly, they carried
out a (formal) act not by rule, in a complete assembly, they carried out a
(formal) act by a rule, in an incomplete assembly, they carried out a (formal)
act, by what had the appearance of a rule, in an incomplete assembly, they
carried out a (formal) act by what had the appearance of a rule, in a complete
assembly; and one <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.451" href="#BD.4.451"></a>
suspended one and one suspended two and one suspended several and one suspended
an Order, and two suspended one and two suspended two and two suspended several
and two suspended an Order, and several suspended one and several suspended two
and several suspended several and several suspended an Order, and an Order
suspended an Order.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.2.2" href="#Kd.9.2.2"></a>
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying: “How can these monks at Campā carry out (formal) acts like these? How
can they carry out a (formal) act by rule, in an incomplete assembly? … How can
they carry out a (formal) act by what has the appearance of a rule, in a
complete assembly? And how can one suspend one … and how can an Order suspend
an Order?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks at Campā carry out (formal) acts
like these? <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.316" href="#Vin.1.316"></a>
Do they carry out a (formal) act not by rule, in an incomplete assembly … and
does an Order suspend an Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, it is not fitting in these foolish men, it is not becoming, it is not
suitable, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be
done. How, monks, can these foolish men carry out (formal) acts like these? How
can they carry out a (formal) act not by rule, in an incomplete assembly? … and
how can an Order suspend an Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased …” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.2.3" href="#Kd.9.2.3"></a>
“If, monks, a (formal) act is carried out not by rule, in an incomplete
assembly, it is not a (formal) act and ought not to be carried out. A (formal)
act carried out not by rule, in a complete assembly, is not a formal act and
ought not to be carried out … A (formal) act carried out by what has the
appearance of rule, in a complete assembly, is not a (formal) act and ought not
to be carried out; and if one suspends one it is not a (formal) act and ought
not to be carried out … <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.452" href="#BD.4.452"></a>
and if an Order suspends an Order it is not a (formal) act and ought not to be
carried out.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.2.4" href="#Kd.9.2.4"></a>
“Monks, there are these four (formal) acts: a (formal) act (carried out) not by
rule, in an incomplete assembly; a (formal) act (carried out) not by rule in a
complete assembly; a (formal) act (carried out) by rule in an incomplete
assembly; a (formal) act (carried out) by rule in a complete assembly. Herein,
monks, that which is a (formal) act (carried out) not by rule, in an incomplete
assembly, this (formal) act, monks, because it lacks reference to rule, because
of the incompleteness (of the assembly), is reversible, is not fit to stand.
Monks, a (formal) act like this should not be carried out, and a (formal) act
like this is not allowed by me. Herein, monks, that which is a (formal) act
(carried out) not by rule, in a complete assembly, this (formal) act, monks,
because it lacks reference to rule, is reversible, is not fit to stand … and a
(formal) act like this is not allowed by me. Herein, monks, that which is a
(formal) act (carried out) by rule, in an incomplete assembly, this (formal)
act, monks, because of the incompleteness (of the assembly), is reversible … is
not allowed by me. Herein, monks, that which is a (formal) act (carried out) by
rule, in a complete assembly, this (formal) act, monks, because it has
reference to rule, because of the completeness (of the assembly), is
irreversible, it is fit to stand. Monks, a (formal) act like this may be
carried out and a (formal) act like this is allowed by me. Therefore, monks,
thinking: ‘We will carry out a (formal) act like this, that is to say by rule,
in a complete assembly’—it is thus that you must train yourselves.”</p>
<h2>On an act without a motion, etc.</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.9.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.9.3.1" href="#Kd.9.3.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks carried out (formal) acts like these:
they carried out a (formal) act not by rule in an incomplete assembly; they
carried out a (formal) act not by rule in a complete assembly; they carried out
a (formal) act by rule in an incomplete assembly; they carried out a (formal)
act by what had the appearance of a rule in an incomplete assembly; they
carried out a (formal) act by what had the appearance of a rule in a complete
assembly; they also carried out a (formal) act for which a motion had not been
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.453" href="#BD.4.453"></a>
furnished although a proclamation had been furnished; they also carried out a
(formal) act for which a proclamation had not been furnished although a motion
had been furnished; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.317" href="#Vin.1.317"></a>
they also carried out a (formal) act for which a motion had not been furnished
and for which a proclamation had not been furnished; they also carried out a
(formal) act that was against the rule; they also carried out a (formal) act
that was against discipline; they also carried out a (formal) act that was
against the Teacher’s instruction; they also carried out a (formal) act that
had been protested against, that was not legitimate, reversible, not fit to
stand. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks carry out (formal) acts like these? How can
they carry out a (formal) act not by rule in an incomplete assembly? … How can
they carry out a (formal) act that has been protested against, that is not
legitimate, reversible, not fit to stand?” Then these monks told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>

“Monks, there are these six (formal) acts: a (formal) act (carried out) not by

ordination in the middle districts<br>
(and) rehabilitation—<br>
the carrying out is by means of a fivefold Order. /<br>
Excluding rehabilitation alone—<br>
these monks are tenfold,<br>
an Order of twenty carries out all (formal) acts, <br>
it is the carrier out of everything. /<br>
Nun, probationer and novice, woman novice,<br>
disavower, (one who has committed) an extreme offence, <br>
one suspended for not seeing an offence, / <br>
For not making amends for, <br>
(for not giving up) a wrong view, eunuch, <br>
one living in communion as it were by theft,<br>
(one gone over to) a sect, an animal, slayer of mother, of father, /<br>
Of one perfected, seducer of a nun, schismatic, <br>
shedder of (a Truthfinder’s) blood, <br>
hermaphrodite,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.480" href="#BD.4.480"></a>
one belonging to a different communion, <br>
staying within a different boundary, <br>
(standing above the ground) by psychic power, /<br>
One against whom an Order is carrying out a (formal) act—<br>
these come to be twenty-four <br>
(and) they are objected to by the Awakened One <br>
for they are not completers of a group./<br>
If one undergoing probation should <br>
as the fourth member grant probation <br>
or should rehabilitate one (sent back to) the beginning <br>
or (undergoing) <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> it is not a (formal) act<br>
and should not be carried out. /<br>
So too, if one deserving the beginning <br>
or <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> (should rehabilitate) <br>
one deserving rehabilitation—<br>
this is not in accordance with a (formal) act—<br>
the five are explained by the All-awakened One. /<br>
Nun, probationer, novice, woman novice,<br>
disavower, (one who has committed) <br>
an extreme (offence), who is mad, <br>
unhinged, in pain, (suspended) for not seeing, /<br>
For not making amends for, for (not giving up) a wrong view, <br>
and a eunuch and a hermaphrodite,<br>
one belonging to a different communion (or) boundary <br>
(or standing) above the ground (by psychic power) <br>
and one against whom a (formal) act is being carried out, /
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.335" href="#Vin.1.335"></a>
<br>
Of these eighteen the protest is not valid,<br>
the protest is valid of a regular monk. /<br>
A pure one may be wrongly sent away, <br>
and an ignorant one rightly sent away,<br>
eunuch, one living in communion as it were by theft, <br>
going over (to a sect), an animal, /<br>
(Slayer) of mother, of father, of one perfected, <br>
seducer (of a nun), schismatic of the Order, <br>
shedder of (a Truth-finder’s) blood <br>
and also a hermaphrodite and whichever /<br>
Of these eleven is not meant for restoration.<br>
Hands, feet, both these, ears, nose, both these, /<br>
Fingers, nails, tendons, one who has webbed hands, <br>
hunchback, and dwarf,<br>
one who has goitre, who has been branded, scourged, <br>
and who has been written about <br>
and one who has elephantiasis, /<br>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.481" href="#BD.4.481"></a>
One who is badly ill, who has disgraced an assembly, who is blind, <br>
and one with a crooked limb, lame, and also one who is paralysed,<br>
a cripple, one weak through age, blind from birth, dumb, and deaf, /<br>
Blind and dumb, (blind and) deaf, and dumb and deaf likewise,<br>
and blind-deaf-dumb: all these thirty-two—/ <br>
Their restoration was explained by the all enlightened one.<br>
(An offence) that should be seen, <br>
for which amends should be made, <br>
(a wrong view) to be given up does not exist, /<br>
There are seven (formal) acts suspending him which are not legally valid,<br>
And these seven that are not legally valid for one complying with his falling,
/ <br>
Among (formal) acts there are seven that are legally valid <br>
for one not complying with his falling,<br>
in the presence of, interrogation, <br>
and according as it is and on the acknowledgement, <br>
Innocence, past insanity, depravity, and on account of censure,<br>
banishment, reconciliation, and suspension, probation, / <br>
The beginning, <i lang="pi">mānatta</i>, rehabilitation, and thus ordination:<br>
These sixteen are not legally valid if it should carry out one for another, /<br>
These sixteen are quite legally valid <br>
if it should carry out the appropriate one for that one,<br>
reciprocally they should explain <br>
how these sixteen are not legally valid, /<br>
When conditioned for it paired: <br>
these sixteen are also legally valid,<br>
when conditioned (for it) singly: <br>
the conqueror said the cycle is not legal. /<br>
One who makes strife: <br>
the Order carries out a (formal) act of banishment
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.482" href="#BD.4.482"></a>
<br>
not by rule, in an incomplete assembly; <br>
he goes to another residence, /<br>
There they carried out a (formal) act of censure against him, <br>
not by rule, in a complete assembly,<br>
elsewhere they carried out a (formal) act of banishment against him <br>
by rule, in an incomplete assembly, /<br>
And they likewise carried out one which in both cases <br>
had the appearance of rule, <br>
in an incomplete assembly, in a complete assembly,<br>
and not by rule in a complete assembly, <br>
also by rule in an incomplete assembly, /<br>
And by what had the appearance of rule <br>
in an incomplete assembly, and in a complete assembly:<br>
these cases, having done what is conditioned singly, <br>
put the cycle together. /<br>
Guidance for one who is ignorant, inexperienced, <br>
banishment for one who brings a family into disrepute,<br>
And they carried out a (formal) act of reconciliation for a reviler, /
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.336" href="#Vin.1.336"></a>
<br>
And for whoever does not see, does not make amends for (an offence), <br>
does not give up a (wrong) view:<br>
for these a (formal) act of suspension <br>
was decreed by the leader of the caravan. /<br>
The wisdom of these (formal) acts of suspension <br>
should be applied to censure,<br>
and if, being subdued, conducting himself properly, he has asked, /<br>
The revocation of these or those (formal) acts <br>
is according to the (formal) acts below.<br>
And if in this or that case he disputes some (formal) act /<br>
And says, “It was not carried out, it was badly carried out, <br>
it should be carried out again”,<br>
further, concerning the revocation of the (formal) act: <br>
these monks are speakers of what is right. /<br>
The Great Sage, having seen falling away from shakiness <br>
in one entitled (to take part in a formal) act<br>
prescribed revocation, as a surgeon medicine.
