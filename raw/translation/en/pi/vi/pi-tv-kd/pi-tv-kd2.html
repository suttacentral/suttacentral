<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.130" href="#BD.4.130"></a>
At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying near Rājagaha on Mount
Vulture Peak. Now at that time wanderers belonging to other sects, having
collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the
half-month. spoke <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, People came up to them to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They gained affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gained
faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gained adherents.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.1.2" href="#Kd.2.1.2"></a>
Then reasoning arose thus in the mind of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as he
was meditating in seclusion: “At present wanderers belonging to other sects,
having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the
half-month, speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. These people go up to them to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They gain affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gain
faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gain adherents. Suppose
the masters should also collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and
eighth days of the half-month?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.1.3" href="#Kd.2.1.3"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Lord; having approached,
having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance, As he was
sitting down at a respectful distance, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke
thus to the Lord: “Now, Lord, as I was meditating in seclusion, a reasoning
arose in my mind thus: ‘At present wanderers belonging to other sects … should
collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the
half-month?’”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.1.4" href="#Kd.2.1.4"></a>
Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, gladdened, … delighted by the Lord
with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.102" href="#Vin.1.102"></a>
having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.131" href="#BD.4.131"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and
eighth days of the half-month.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.2.1" href="#Kd.2.2.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, thinking: “It is allowed by the Lord to assemble
together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month,”
having assembled together, sat down in silence. Those people came up to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these
recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having assembled together on the fourteenth,
fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, sit in silence, like dumb pigs?
Ought not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to be spoken when they are assembled together?” Monks heard these people who …
spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord
on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having assembled together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and
eighth days of the half-month, to speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</span>”</p>
<h2>Allowance to recite the Pātimokkha</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.3.1" href="#Kd.2.3.1"></a>
Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind
thus: “What now if I were to allow those rules of training, laid down by me for
monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act
of observance for them.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.3.2" href="#Kd.2.3.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.132" href="#BD.4.132"></a>
Then the Lord, having emerged from his seclusion in the evening, on this
occasion, in this connection having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying: “Now, monks, as I was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in my
mind thus: ‘What now if I should allow those rules of training, laid down by me
for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal)
act of observance for them’. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite a Pātimokkha.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.3.3" href="#Kd.2.3.3"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be recited: The Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Today, the fifteenth (day), is an
Observance (day). If it seems right to the Order, the Order may carry out
Observance, it may recite the Pātimokkha. What is the Order’s first duty? Let
the venerable ones <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.103" href="#Vin.1.103"></a>
announce entire purity. I will recite the Pātimokkha (while) one and all of us
present listen properly and pay attention to it. He for whom there may be an
offence should reveal it. If there is no offence, you should become silent. By
your becoming silent I shall thus know that the venerable ones are quite pure.
For as there is an answer for each question, so it is proclaimed up to the
third time in an assembly like this. Whatever monk remembering while it is
being proclaimed up to the third time that there is an existent offence and
should not reveal it, there comes to be conscious lying for him. Now, conscious
lying, venerable ones, is a thing called a stumbling-block by the Lord.
Therefore the existent offence should be revealed <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.133" href="#BD.4.133"></a>
by a monk who remembers that he has fallen (into an offence) and who desires
purity; for when it is revealed there comes to be comfort for him.</span>’”</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.4.1" href="#Kd.2.4.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, thinking: “The recital of the Pātimokkha is allowed by
the Lord,” recited the Pātimokkha daily. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited daily. Whoever should (so) recite
it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha on an Observance day.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.4.2" href="#Kd.2.4.2"></a>
Now at that time monks, thinking: “The recital of the Pātimokkha on an
Observance day is allowed by the Lord,” recited the Pātimokkha three times
during the half-month—on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth and on the eighth
(days) of the half-month. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited three times <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.136" href="#BD.4.136"></a>
in the half-month. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha once in the half-month: either on
this fourteenth or on the fifteenth (day).</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.1" href="#Kd.2.5.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks recited the Pātimokkha according to
assembly, each one before his own assembly. They told this matter to the Lord.
He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.105" href="#Vin.1.105"></a>
the Pātimokkha should not be recited according to assembly, each one before his
own assembly, Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a (formal) act of Observance for all together.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.2 " href="#Kd.2.5.2%20"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “A (formal) act of Observance for all together
is allowed by the Lord. Now, how far does ‘being all together’ (go)? As far as
one residence, or the whole earth?” They told this matter to the Lord. He
said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.3" href="#Kd.2.5.3"></a>
“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, ‘being all together’ (to mean) as far as one residence.</span>”</p>
<h2>The story of Mahākappina</h2>
<p>Now at that time the venerable Kappina the Great was staying near Rājagaha at
Maddakucchi in the deer-park. Then as the venerable Kappina the Great was
meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: “Should I go to an
Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or
should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.4" href="#Kd.2.5.4"></a>
Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of the venerable
Kappina the Great, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend
back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from Mount Vulture Peak
appear in Maddakucchi in the deer-park before the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.137" href="#BD.4.137"></a>
venerable Kappina the Great. The Lord sat down on an appointed seat, and the
venerable Kappina the Great, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful
distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.5" href="#Kd.2.5.5"></a>
As the venerable Kappina the Great was sitting down at a respectful distance
the Lord spoke thus to him: “Now, Kappina, as you were meditating in seclusion
did not a reasoning arise in your mind thus: ‘Should I go to an Observance or
should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go,
I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification’?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord.”</p>
<p>“But if you brahmins do not reverence, revere, esteem, honour the Observance,
who is there who will reverence, revere, esteem, honour the Observance? You go
along, brahmin, to the Observance, do not not go; go likewise to a (formal) act
of the Order, do not not go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” the venerable Kappina the Great answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.5.6" href="#Kd.2.5.6"></a>
Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the venerable
Kappina the Great with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend back his outstretched
arm, even so did he, vanishing from before the venerable Kappina the Great in
Maddakucchi in the deer-park appear on Mount Vulture Peak. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.106" href="#Vin.1.106"></a></p>
<h2>Allowance for a boundary</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.6.1" href="#Kd.2.6.1"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “It is laid down by the Lord that ‘being all
together’ (means) as far as one residence. Now, how far does one residence
(go)?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a boundary.</span> And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: First, marks should be announced, a
mark consisting of a hillside, a mark consisting of a rock, a mark consisting
of a grove, a mark consisting of a tree, a mark consisting of a road, a mark
consisting of an anthill, a mark consisting of a river, a mark consisting of (a
piece of) water. The Order, having announced the marks, should be informed by
an experienced, competent <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.138" href="#BD.4.138"></a>
monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are
announced, if it seems right to the Order the Order may agree upon a boundary
in accordance with these marks for the same communion for one Observance. This
is the motion. <a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.6.2" href="#Kd.2.6.2"></a>
Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are
announced, the Order is agreeing upon a boundary in accordance with these marks
for the same communion, for one Observance. If the agreement upon a boundary in
accordance with these marks for the same communion, for one Observance, is
pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak. The boundary in accordance with these marks is agreed
upon by the Order for the same communion, for one Observance. It is pleasing to
the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.7"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.7.1" href="#Kd.2.7.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, thinking: “An agreement upon a
boundary is allowed by the Lord,” agreed upon very extensive boundaries, of
four <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and five <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Monks coming for Observance arrived while the Pātimokkha was being recited,
and they arrived just after it had been recited, and they stayed (a night) on
the way. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, a very extensive boundary should not be agreed upon, of four <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> or five <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> or six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Whoever should (so) agree, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a boundary of three <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> at most.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.7.2" href="#Kd.2.7.2"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks agreed upon the other side of a river
as a boundary. Monks coming for Observance were carried away and their bowls
were carried away and their robes were carried away. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, the other side of a river should not be agreed upon as a boundary.
Whoever should (so) agree, there is an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.139" href="#BD.4.139"></a>
offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when there may be a reliable boat or a reliable bridge to
agree upon the other side of such a river as a boundary.</span>”</p>
<h2>On an observance hall</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.8"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.1" href="#Kd.2.8.1"></a>
Now at that time monks recited the Pātimokkha in successive cells
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.107" href="#Vin.1.107"></a>
without (making) a rendezvous. In-coming monks did not know or they thought,
“Where will the Observance be carried out today?” They told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, the Pātimokkha should not be recited in successive cells without
(making) a rendezvous. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to carry out the Observance having agreed upon an
Observance-hall that the Order desires: a dwelling-place or a curved house or a
long house or a mansion or a cave.</span> And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.2" href="#Kd.2.8.2"></a>
“The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the
Order should agree upon such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall.
This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order is
agreeing upon such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall. If the
agreement upon such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall is pleasing
to the venerable ones, let them be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should
speak. Such and such a dwelling-place as an Observance-hall is agreed upon by
the Order. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I
understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.3" href="#Kd.2.8.3"></a>
Now at that time in a certain residence two Observance-halls came to be agreed
upon. Monks assembled together in <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.140" href="#BD.4.140"></a>
both thinking: “Observance will be carried out here,” “Observance will be
carried out here.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, two Observance-halls in one residence should not be agreed upon. Whoever
should (so) agree, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having abolished one, to carry out the Observance in one
place (only).</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.8.4" href="#Kd.2.8.4"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be abolished: The Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the
Order may abolish such and such an Observance-hall. This is the motion.
Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order is abolishing such and
such an Observance-hall. If the abolition of such and such an Observance-hall
is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not
pleasing should speak. Such and such an Observance-hall is abolished by the
Order. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I
understand this</span>’.”</p>
<h2>On a maximum for observance</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.9.1" href="#Kd.2.9.1"></a>
Now at that time in a certain residence a very small Observance-hall came to be
agreed upon. A large Order of monks came to be assembled together on an
Observance-day. Monks, sitting on ground that had not been agreed upon, heard
the Pātimokkha. Then it occurred to these monks: “It is laid down by the Lord <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.108" href="#Vin.1.108"></a>
that the Observance is to be carried out having agreed upon an Observance-hall,
but we heard the Pātimokkha while we were sitting on ground that was not agreed
upon. Now was the Observance carried out for us or was it not carried out?”
They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Monks, if one is sitting on the ground, whether it has been agreed upon or not
agreed upon, and hears the Pātimokkha from there, the Observance is carried out
for him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.9.2" href="#Kd.2.9.2"></a>
“Well then, monks, if an Order desires a maximum for
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="BD.4.141" href="#BD.4.141"></a>
Observance of a certain size let it agree upon a maximum for Observance of that
size. And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: First, marks should be
announced. The Order, having announced the marks, should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are
announced, if it seems right to the Order the Order may agree upon a maximum
for Observance in accordance with these marks. This is the motion. Honoured
sirs, let the Order listen to me. In as much as marks all round are announced,
the Order is agreeing upon the maximum for Observance in accordance with these
marks. If the agreement upon a maximum for Observance in accordance with these

Now at that time in a certain residence newly ordained monks, being the first
to have assembled together on an Observance day, saying: “The elders are not
coming yet,” went away. The Observance was not at a right time. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

Now at that time in Rājagaha several residences came to have the same boundary.
Monks quarrelled about this, saying: “Let the Observance be carried out in our
residence,” “Let the Observance be carried out in our residence.” They told
this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“This is a case, monks, where several residences come to

have the same boundary. Monks quarrel about this, saying: ‘Let the Observance
be carried out in our residence’, ‘Let the Observance be carried out in our
residence’. Monks those monks, one and all, having assembled together in one
place, should carry out the Observance, or, having assembled together they
should carry out the Observance there where a monk who is an elder is staying.
<span class="rule">But the Observance should not be carried out by an incomplete Order. Whoever

Now at one time the venerable Kassapa the Great, going from Andhakavinda to
Rājagaha for Observance and crossing a river on the way, was nearly carried
away, and his robes got wet. Monks spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa the
Great: “Why are your robes wet, your reverence?”</p>
<p>“Now I, your reverences, coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the
Observance and crossing a river on the way, was nearly carried away. Because of
this my robes are wet.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Whatever boundary, monks, is agreed upon by an Order for the same communion,
for one Observance, let the Order agree (to regard) that boundary (as a place
where a monk is) not away, separated from the three robes.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.12.2" href="#Kd.2.12.2"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be agreed upon: The Order should be informed by an

Now at that time monks, thinking: “An agreement (for a monk to be regarded) as
not away, separated from the three robes is allowed by the Lord,” laid aside
robes in a house. These robes were lost and burnt and eaten by rats. The monks
became badly dressed, their robes worn thin. Monks spoke thus: “Why are you,
your reverences, badly dressed, your robes worn thin?”</p>
<p>“Now we, your reverences, thinking: ‘An agreement (for a monk to be regarded)

Now at that time the group of six monks combined boundary with boundary. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, those for whom a boundary was

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.14.2" href="#Kd.2.14.2"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many (formal) acts for Observance are
there?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these
four (formal) acts for Observance: a (formal) act for Observance (carried out)
not by rule when an Order is incomplete; a (formal) act for Observance (carried
out) not by rule when an Order is complete; a (formal) act for Observance
(carried out) by rule when an Order is incomplete; a (formal) act for

Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many ways for the recital of the
Pātimokkha are there?”. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks,
there are these five (ways for the) recital of the Pātimokkha: having recited
the provenance, the rest may be announced as though it had been (already)

Now, at that time, monks, thinking: “Recital of the Pātimokkha in brief is

Now at that time in a certain residence in the Kosala country there came to be
a menace from savages on an Observance day. The monks were unable to recite the

<p>Then the Lord, having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Codanāvatthu. In due course, walking on a tour, he arrived in
Codanāvatthu. Now at that time several monks were staying in a certain
residence; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.116" href="#Vin.1.116"></a>
the monk who there was the elder was ignorant,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.153" href="#BD.4.153"></a>
inexperienced, he did not know the Observance or a (formal) act for Observance
or the Pātimokkha or the recital of the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.2.17"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.17.2" href="#Kd.2.17.2"></a>
Then it occurred to these monks: “It is laid down by the Lord that the
Pātimokkha be in charge of an elder, but this elder of ours is ignorant,
inexperienced, he does not know the Observance … or the recital of the
Pātimokkha. Now what line of conduct should be followed by us?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, the Pātimokkha to be discharged by whoever there is an
experienced, competent monk.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.17.3" href="#Kd.2.17.3"></a>
Now at that time several ignorant, inexperienced monks were staying in a
certain residence on an Observance day. These did not know the Observance or a
(formal) act for Observance or the Pātimokkha or the recital of the Pātimokkha.
These called upon an elder, saying: “Honoured sir, let the elder recite the
Pātimokkha.” He spoke thus: “Your reverences, I am not able to do so.” They
called upon a second elder … He also spoke thus: … They called upon a third
elder … In this way they called upon (all the monks) down to the most newly
ordained in the Order, saying: “Let the venerable one recite the Pātimokkha.”
He also spoke thus: “Honoured sirs, I am not able to do so.” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.17.4" href="#Kd.2.17.4"></a>

“This is a case, monks, where several ignorant, inexperienced monks are staying

monk should immediately be sent to a neighbouring residence by these monks,
saying: ‘Do go, your reverence; having mastered the Pātimokkha in brief or in
full, come back’.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.17.6" href="#Kd.2.17.6"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, by whom should he be sent?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to enjoin a newly ordained monk through a monk who is an
elder.</span>” Newly ordained monks, (although) enjoined by an elder, did not go. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks,

Then the Lord, having stayed at Codanāvatthu for as long as he found suiting,
returned again to Rājagaha. Now at that time people asked the monks as they
were walking for almsfood: “Which (day) of the half-month is it, honoured
sirs?” The monks spoke thus: “We, sirs, do not know.” The people … spread it
about, saying: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, do not even know the
calculation of the half-months, so how can they know anything else that is
good?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, you, monks, to learn the calculation of the half-months.</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.18.4" href="#Kd.2.18.4"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how should the monks be counted?” They told

Now at that time monks, not knowing, “Today is an Observance day,” walked to a
distant village for almsfood. Not only did these come back while the Pātimokkha
was being recited, but they came back just after it had been recited. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.155" href="#BD.4.155"></a>
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to announce, ‘Today is an Observance day’.</span>” Then it occurred to monks: “Now, by whom should it be announced?” They told

come for it; now comes for a (formal) act of the Order, now does not come for

madman to the mad monk Gagga, so that whether the monk Gagga remembers the
Observance or does not remember it, whether he remembers a (formal) act of the
Order or does not remember it, whether he comes for the Observance or does not

Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The mad monk Gagga now remembers the
Observance … now comes <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.164" href="#BD.4.164"></a>
for a (formal) act of the Order, now does not come for it. The Order is giving
the agreement for a madman to the mad monk Gagga so that whether the monk Gagga
remembers … or does not come for it, the Order either with Gagga or without
Gagga will carry out the Observance, will carry out a (formal) act of the
Order. If the giving of the agreement for a madman to the mad monk Gagga so
that whether he remembers … or does not come for it, the Order either with
Gagga or without Gagga will carry out the Observance, will carry out a (formal)
act of the Order, is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he
to whom it is not pleasing should speak. The agreement for a madman is given by
the Order to the mad monk Gagga, so that whether he remembers … or does not
come for it, the Order either with Gagga or without Gagga will carry out the
Observance, will carry out a (formal) act of the Order. It is pleasing to the
Order, therefore it is silent; thus do I understand this</span>’.”

Now at that time in a certain residence the whole Order came to have fallen
into a collective offence. It did not know the name or the class of that
offence. A certain monk came there; he had heard much, he was one to whom the
tradition had been handed down; he was an expert on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, an expert on discipline, an expert on the summaries; he was wise,
experienced, clever; he was conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training. A
certain monk approached that monk; having approached, he spoke thus to him:
“What kind of an offence does he fall into, your reverence, who does such and
such a thing?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.11" href="#Kd.2.27.11"></a>
He spoke thus: “Whoever does such and such a thing,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.170" href="#BD.4.170"></a>
your reverence, falls into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence
that you, your reverence, have fallen into; make amends for this offence.” He
spoke thus: “I, your reverence, have not fallen into this offence altogether
alone; this <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.128" href="#Vin.1.128"></a>
whole Order has fallen into this offence.” He spoke thus: “What has it to do

do you, your reverence, remove your own offence.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.12" href="#Kd.2.27.12"></a>
Then that monk, having at that monk’s bidding made amends for that offence,
approached those monks; having approached them, he spoke thus to those monks:
“It is said, your reverences, that whoever does such and such a thing falls
into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your
reverences, have fallen into; make amends for this offence.” But these monks
did not want to make amends for that offence at that monk’s bidding. They told
this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.13" href="#Kd.2.27.13"></a>
“This is a case, monks, where in a certain residence the whole Order comes to
have fallen into a collective offence. It does not know the name or the class

does such and such a thing?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.14" href="#Kd.2.27.14"></a>
“He speaks thus: ‘Whoever does such and such a thing, your reverence, falls
into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your
reverence, have fallen into; make amends for this offence’. He speaks thus: ‘I,
your reverence, have not fallen into this offence altogether alone; this whole
Order has fallen into this offence’. He speaks thus: ‘What has it to do with
you, your reverence, whether another has fallen or has not fallen? Please do
you, your reverence, remove your own offence.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.2.27.15" href="#Kd.2.27.15"></a>
“Then if that monk, having at that monk’s bidding made amends for that offence,
approaches those monks and having approached them speaks thus to those monks:
‘It is said, your reverence, that whoever does such and such a thing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.171

falls into this kind of offence. This is the kind of offence that you, your
reverences, have fallen into; make amends for this offence’; and if, monks,
these monks should make amends for that offence at that monk’s bidding, that is
good. But if they should not make amends for it, then, monks, these monks need
not be spoken to by that monk if he is not willing.”</p>
