<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1" href="#Vin.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.1" href="#BD.4.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.1" href="#Vin.1.1"></a>At one time the awakened one, the Lord, being recently fully awakened, was
staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the foot of the Tree
of Awakening. Then the Lord sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at
the foot of the Tree of Awakening experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.2" href="#Kd.1.1.2"></a>
Then the Lord during the first watch of the night paid attention to causal
uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual
tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness;
conditioned by consciousness is psycho-physicality; conditioned by
psycho-physicality are the six (sense-) spheres; conditioned by the six
(sense-) spheres is awareness; conditioned by awareness is feeling; conditioned
by feeling is craving; conditioned by craving is grasping; conditioned by
grasping is becoming; conditioned by becoming is birth; conditioned by birth,
old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and
despair come into being.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.2" href="#BD.4.2"></a>
Such is the arising of this entire mass of ill. But from the utter fading away
and stopping of this very ignorance (comes) the stopping of habitual
tendencies; from the stopping of habitual tendencies the stopping of
consciousness; from the stopping of consciousness the stopping of
psycho-physicality; from the stopping of psycho-physicality the stopping of the
six (sense-) spheres; from the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres the
stopping of awareness; from the stopping of awareness the stopping of feeling;
from the stopping of feeling the stopping of craving; from the stopping of
craving the stopping of grasping; from the stopping of grasping the stopping of
becoming; from the stopping of becoming the stopping of birth; from the
stopping of birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering,
dejection and despair are stopped. Such is the stopping of this entire mass of
ill. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.2" href="#Vin.1.2"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.3" href="#Kd.1.1.3"></a>
Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this
(solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Truly, when things grow plain <br>
to the ardent meditating brahmin,<br>
His doubts all vanish <br>
in that he comprehends thing-with-cause.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.4" href="#Kd.1.1.4"></a>
Then the Lord during the middle watch of the night paid attention to causal
uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual
tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness … Such is
the arising … Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.5" href="#Kd.1.1.5"></a>
Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this
(solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Truly, when things grow plain <br>
to the ardent meditating brahmin,<br>
His doubts all vanish <br>
in that he discerns destruction of cause.”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.6" href="#Kd.1.1.6"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.3" href="#BD.4.3"></a>
Then the Lord during the last watch of the night paid attention to causal
uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual
tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness … Such is
the arising … Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.7" href="#Kd.1.1.7"></a>
Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this
(solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Truly, when things grow plain <br>
to the ardent meditating brahmin,<br>
Routing the host of Māra does he stand<br>
Like as the sun when lighting up the sky.”</p>

<h2>At the Goatherds’ Banyan tree</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.2.1" href="#Kd.1.2.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days,
approached the Goatherds’ Banyan from the foot of the Tree of Awakening; having
approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of
the Goatherds’ Banyan experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.2.2" href="#Kd.1.2.2"></a>
Then a certain brahmin of the class uttering the sound <i lang="pi">huṁ</i> approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord;
having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he stood at a
respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, that brahmin
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.3" href="#Vin.1.3"></a>
spoke thus to the Lord: “To what extent, good Gotama, does one become a
brahmin? And again, what are the things which make a brahmin?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.2.3" href="#Kd.1.2.3"></a>
Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this
(solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.4" href="#BD.4.4"></a>
“That brahmin who bars out evil things, <br>
not uttering the sound <i lang="pi">hum</i>, <br>
with no impurity, curbed-of-self,<br>
Master of Vedas, who lives the Brahma-faring—<br>
this is the brahmin who may rightly speak the Brahma-speech<br>
Who has no blemishes anywhere in the world.”
</p>

<h2>On Mucalinda</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.3.1" href="#Kd.1.3.1"></a>
Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that
contemplation, approached the Mucalinda (tree) from the foot of the Goatherds’
Banyan; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days
at the foot of the Mucalinda experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.3.2" href="#Kd.1.3.2"></a>
Now at that time a great storm arose out of due season, for seven days there
was rainy weather, cold winds and overcast skies. Then Mucalinda, the serpent
king, having come forth from his own haunt, having encircled the Lord’s body
seven times with his coils, having spread a great hood over his head, stood
saying: “Let no cold (annoy) the Lord, let no heat (annoy) the Lord, let not
the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and heat or creeping things (annoy) the
Lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.3.3" href="#Kd.1.3.3"></a>
Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, at the end of those seven days, having known
that the sky was clear and without a cloud, having unwound his coils from the
Lord’s body, having given up his own form and assumed a youth’s form, stood in
front of the Lord honouring the Lord with joined palms.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.3.4" href="#Kd.1.3.4"></a>
Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this
(solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.5" href="#BD.4.5"></a>
“Happy his solitude who glad at heart <br>
Hath <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> learnt and doth the vision see!<br>
Happy is that benignity towards<br>
The world which on no creature worketh harm.<br>
Happy the absence of all lust, th’ ascent <br>
Past and beyond the needs of sense-desires.<br>
He who doth crush the great ‘I am’ conceit—<br>
This, truly this, is happiness supreme.”
</p>

<h2>At the Rājāyatana tree</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.4.1" href="#Kd.1.4.1"></a>
Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that
contemplation, approached the Rājāyatana from the foot of the Mucalinda; having
approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of
the Rājāyatana experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.4.2" href="#Kd.1.4.2"></a>
Now
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.4" href="#Vin.1.4"></a>
at that time the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were going along the high-road
from Ukkalā to that district. Then a <i lang="pi">devatā</i> who was a blood-relation of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to
the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika: “My good fellows, this Lord, having just
(become) wholly awakened, is staying at the foot of the Rājāyatana, go and
serve that Lord with barley-gruel and honey-balls, and this will be a blessing
and happiness for you for a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.4.3" href="#Kd.1.4.3"></a>
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, taking barley-gruel and honey-balls,
approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they stood at
a respectful distance. As they were standing at a respectful distance, the
merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, let the Lord
receive our barley-gruel and honey-balls, that this may be a blessing and
happiness for us for a long time.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.4.4" href="#Kd.1.4.4"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Truth-finders do not
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.6" href="#BD.4.6"></a>
receive with their hands. Now with what shall I receive the barley-gruel and
honey-balls?” Then the four Great Kings, knowing with their minds the reasoning
in the Lord’s mind, from the four quarters presented the Lord with four bowls
made of rock crystal, saying: “Lord, let the Lord receive the barley-gruel and
honey-balls herein.” The Lord received the barley-gruel and the honey-balls in
a new bowl made of rock crystal, and having received them he partook of them.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.4.5" href="#Kd.1.4.5"></a>
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, having found that the Lord had removed
his hand from the bowl, having inclined their heads towards the Lord’s feet,
spoke thus to the Lord: “We, Lord, are those going to the Lord for refuge and
to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; let the Lord accept us as lay-disciples gone for refuge for life from this
day forth.” Thus these came to be the first lay-disciples in the world using
the two-word formula.</p>
<p class="end"><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.4.6" href="#Kd.1.4.6"></a>
Told is the Talk at the Rājāyatana.</p>
<h2>On the invitation of Brahmā</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.1" href="#Kd.1.5.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days,
approached the Goatherds’ Banyan from the foot of the Rājāyatana; having
approached, the Lord stayed there at the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.2" href="#Kd.1.5.2"></a>
Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind
thus: “This <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, won to by me, is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful,
excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the learned. But this is a
creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure,
rejoicing in sensual pleasure. So that for a creation delighting in sensual
pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure, this
were a matter difficult to see, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.5" href="#Vin.1.5"></a>
that is to say causal uprising by way of
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.7" href="#BD.4.7"></a>
cause. This too were a matter very difficult to see, that is to say the calming
of all the habitual tendencies, the renunciation of all attachment, the
destruction of craving, dispassion, stopping, <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>. And so if I were to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and others were not to understand me, this would be a weariness to me, this
would be a vexation to me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.3" href="#Kd.1.5.3"></a>
And further, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously
to the Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“This that through many toils I’ve won—<br>
Enough! Why should I make it known?<br>
By folk with lust and hate consumed<br>
This <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is not understood.</p>
<p>Leading on against the stream,<br>
Subtle, deep, difficult to see, delicate,<br>
Unseen ‘twill be by passion’s slaves<br>
Cloaked in the murk of ignorance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.4" href="#Kd.1.5.4"></a>
In such wise, as the Lord pondered, his mind inclined to little effort and not
to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati, knowing with his mind the reasoning in
the Lord’s mind: “Alas, the world is lost, alas, the world is destroyed,
inasmuch as the mind of the Truth-finder, the perfected one, the fully awakened
one, inclines to little effort and not to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.5" href="#Kd.1.5.5"></a>
Then as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm or might bend back his
outstretched arm, even so did Brahmā Sahampati, vanishing from the
Brahma-world, become manifest before the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.6" href="#Kd.1.5.6"></a>
Then Brahmā Sahampati, having arranged his upper robe
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.8" href="#BD.4.8"></a>
over one shoulder, having stooped his right knee to the ground having saluted
the Lord with joined palms, spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, let the Lord teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, let the Well-farer teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; there are beings with little dust in their eyes who, not hearing <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, are decaying, (but if) they are learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.7" href="#Kd.1.5.7"></a>
Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati; having said this, he further spoke thus:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“There has appeared in Magadha before thee<br>
An unclean <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> by impure minds devised. <br>
Open this door of deathlessness, let them hear<br>
<i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> awakened to by the stainless one.</p>
<p>“As on a crag on crest of mountain standing
<br>
A man might watch the people far below,<br>
E’en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br>
O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.6" href="#Vin.1.6"></a>
<br>
Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples<br>
Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.</p>
<p>“Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br>
Thou freed from debt! Man of the caravan!<br>
Walk the world over, let the Blessed One<br>
Teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They who learn will grow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.8" href="#Kd.1.5.8"></a>
When he had spoken thus, the Lord spoke thus to Brahmā Sahampati: “Brahmā, it
occurred to me: ‘This <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> penetrated by me is deep … that would be a vexation to me.’ And further,
Brahmā, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to me:
‘This that through many toils I’ve won … cloaked in the murk of ignorance.’ In
such wise, Brahmā, as I pondered, my mind inclined to little effort and not to
teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.9" href="#Kd.1.5.9"></a>
Then a second time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: “Lord, let the
Lord teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … if they are
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.9" href="#BD.4.9"></a>
learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow.” Then a second time did the Lord speak thus to Brahmā
Sahampati: “But, Brahmā, it occurred to me: … my mind inclined to little effort
and and not to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.10" href="#Kd.1.5.10"></a>
Then a third time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: “Lord, let the
Lord teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … if they are learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow.” Then the Lord, having understood Brahmā’s entreaty and, out
of compassion for beings, surveyed the world with the eye of an awakened one.
As the Lord was surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one, he saw
beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with acute
faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions,
docile, indocile, few seeing fear in sins and the worlds beyond.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.11" href="#Kd.1.5.11"></a>
Even as in a pond of blue lotuses or in a pond of red lotuses or in a pond of
white lotuses, a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow
in the water, do not rise above the water but thrive while altogether immersed;
a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water and
reach to the surface of the water; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born
in the water, grow in the water, and stand up rising out of the water,
undefiled by the water.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.1.12" href="#Kd.1.1.12"></a>
Even so, did the Lord, surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one, see
beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.7" href="#Vin.1.7"></a>
with acute faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad
dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing fear in sins and the worlds beyond.
Seeing Brahmā Sahampati, he addressed him with verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Open for those who hear are the doors of deathlessness;<br>
let them renounce their faith.<br>
Thinking of useless fatigue, I have not preached, Brahmā, the<br>
sublime and excellent <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to men.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.13" href="#Kd.1.5.13"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.10" href="#BD.4.10"></a>
Then Brahmā Sahampati, thinking: “The opportunity was made by me for the Lord
to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,” greeting the Lord, keeping his right side towards him, vanished then and
there.</p>
<p class="end"><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.5.14" href="#Kd.1.5.14"></a>
Told is the Talk on Brahmā’s Entreaty.</p>
<h2>On the group of five</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.1" href="#Kd.1.6.1"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Now, to whom should I first teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>? Who will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly?” Then it occurred to the Lord: “Indeed, this Āḷāra the Kālāma is
learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his
eyes. Suppose I were to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> first to Āḷāra the Kālāma? He will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.2" href="#Kd.1.6.2"></a>
But then an invisible <i lang="pi">devatā</i> announced to the Lord: “Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago.”
And the knowledge arose to the Lord that Āḷāra the Kālāma had passed away seven
days ago. Then it occurred to the Lord: “Āḷāra the Kālāma was of great
intelligence. If he had heard this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, he would have understood it quickly.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.3" href="#Kd.1.6.3"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Now, to whom should I first teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>? Who will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly?” Then it occurred to the Lord: “Indeed, this Uddaka, Rāma’s son, is
learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his
eyes. Suppose I were to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> first to Uddaka, Rāma’s son? He will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.4" href="#Kd.1.6.4"></a>
But then an invisible <i lang="pi">devatā</i> announced to the Lord: “Lord, Uddaka, Rāma’s son, passed away last night.” And
the knowledge arose to the Lord that Uddaka, Rāma’s son, had passed away last
night. Then it occurred to the Lord: “Uddaka, Rāma’s son, was of great
intelligence. If he had <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.11" href="#BD.4.11"></a>
heard this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, he would have understood it quickly.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.5" href="#Kd.1.6.5"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Now, to whom should I first teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>? Who
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.8" href="#Vin.1.8"></a>
will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly?” Then it occurred to the Lord: “That group of five monks who waited
on me when I was self-resolute in striving were very helpful. Suppose I were to
teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> first to the group of five monks?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.6" href="#Kd.1.6.6"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “But where is this group of five monks staying at
present? Then the Lord with <em>deva</em>-vision, purified and surpassing that of men, saw the group of five monks
staying near Benares at Isipatana in the deer-park. Then the Lord, having
stayed at Uruvelā for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for
Benares.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.7" href="#Kd.1.6.7"></a>
Upaka, a Naked Ascetic, saw the Lord going along the highroad between Gayā and
the (Tree of) Awakening; seeing him, he spoke thus to the Lord: “Your
reverence, your sense-organs are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very
clear. On account of whom have you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your
teacher, or whose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> do you profess?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.8" href="#Kd.1.6.8"></a>
When this had been said, the Lord addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, in
verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Victorious over all, omniscient am I,<br>
Among all things undefiled,<br>
Leaving all, through death of craving freed,<br>
By knowing for myself, whom should I follow?</p>
<p>“For me there is no teacher,<br>
One like me does not exist,<br>
In the world with its <i lang="pi">devas</i><br>
No one equals me.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.12" href="#BD.4.12"></a>
“For I am perfected in the world,<br>
The teacher supreme am I,<br>
I alone am all-awakened,<br>
Become cool am I, <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>-attained.</p>
<p>“To turn the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-wheel<br>
I go to Kasi’s city,<br>
Beating the drum of deathlessness<br>
In a world that’s blind become.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.9" href="#Kd.1.6.9"></a>
“According to what you claim, your reverence, you ought to be victor of the
unending” (Upaka said).</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Like me, they are victors indeed,<br>
Who have won to destruction of the cankers;<br>
Vanquished by me are evil things,<br>
Therefore am I, Upaka, a victor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this had been said, Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, having said, “It may be
(so), your reverence,” having shaken his head, went off taking a different
road.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.10" href="#Kd.1.6.10"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.13" href="#BD.4.13"></a>
Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course approached Benares, the deer-park
of Isipatana, the group of five monks. The group of five monks saw the Lord
coming in the distance; seeing him, they agreed among themselves, saying: “Your
reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming, he lives in abundance, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.9" href="#Vin.1.9"></a>
he is wavering in his striving, he has reverted to a life of abundance. He
should neither be greeted, nor stood up for, nor should his bowl and robe be
received; all the same a seat may be put out, he can sit down if he wants to.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.11" href="#Kd.1.6.11"></a>
But as the Lord gradually approached this group of five monks, so this group of
five monks, not adhering to their own agreement, having gone towards the Lord,
one received his bowl and robe, one made ready a seat, one brought water for
washing the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand. The Lord sat down on the seat
made ready, and the Lord, while he was sitting down, washed his feet. Further,
they addressed the Lord by name and with the epithet of “your reverence.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.12" href="#Kd.1.6.12"></a>
When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: “Do
not, monks, address a Truthfinder by name, and with the epithet ‘your
reverence’. A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one.
Give ear, monks, the deathless has been found; <em>I</em> instruct,
<em>I</em> teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Going along in accordance with what has been enjoined, having soon realised
here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahma-faring
for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into
homelessness, you will abide in it.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.13" href="#Kd.1.6.13"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.14" href="#BD.4.14"></a>
When this had been said, the group of five monks spoke thus to the Lord: “But
you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men, to the eminence
of truly <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> vision of knowledge, by this conduct, by this course, by this practice of
austerities. So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to the eminence
of the truly <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> vision of knowledge, when you live in abundance, are wavering in striving, and
have reverted to a life of abundance?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.14" href="#Kd.1.6.14"></a>
When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: “A
Truthfinder, monks, does not live in abundance, he does not waver in striving,
he does not revert to a life of abundance. A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected
one, a fully awakened one. Give ear, monks, the deathless has been found; <em>I</em> instruct,
<em>I</em> teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Going along in accordance with what has been enjoined, having soon realised
here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahma-faring
for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into
homelessness, you will abide in it.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.15" href="#Kd.1.6.15"></a>
And a second time did the group of five monks speak thus to the Lord … And a
second time did the Lord speak thus to the group of five monks … And a third
time did the group of five monks speak thus to the Lord: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.10" href="#Vin.1.10"></a>
“But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men … by this
practice of austerities … to a life of abundance?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.16" href="#Kd.1.6.16"></a>
When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: “Do
you allow, monks, that I have never spoken to you like this before?”</p>
<p>“You have not, Lord.”</p>
<p>“A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear … you
will abide in it.” And the Lord was able to convince the group of five monks.
Then the group of five monks listened to the Lord again, gave ear to him and
aroused their minds for profound knowledge.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.17" href="#Kd.1.6.17"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.15" href="#BD.4.15"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the group of five monks, saying: “These two (dead)
ends, monks, should not be followed by one who has gone forth. Which two? That
which is, among sense-pleasures, addiction to attractive sense-pleasures, low,
of the villager, of the average man, unariyan, not connected with the goal; and
that which is addiction to self-torment, ill, unariyan, not connected with the
goal. Now, monks, without adopting either of these two (dead) ends, there is a
middle course, fully awakened to by the Truthfinder, making for vision, making
for knowledge, which conduces to calming, to super-knowledge, to awakening, to
<i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.18" href="#Kd.1.6.18"></a>
“And what, monks, is this middle course fully awakened to by the Truthfinder,
making for vision, making for knowledge, which conduces to calming, to
super-knowledge, to awakening, to <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>? It is this <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> eightfold Way itself, that is to say: right view, right thought, right speech,
right action, right mode of living, right endeavour, right mindfulness, right
concentration. This, monks, is the middle course, fully awakened to by the
Truthfinder, making for vision, making <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.16" href="#BD.4.16"></a>
for knowledge, which conduces to calming, to super-knowledge to awakening, to <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.19" href="#Kd.1.6.19"></a>
“And this, monks, is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of ill: birth is ill, and old age is ill and disease is ill and dying is
ill, association with what is not dear is ill, separation from what is dear is
ill, not getting what one wants is ill—in short the five groups of grasping are
ill.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.20" href="#Kd.1.6.20"></a>
“And this, monks, is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the uprising of ill: that which is craving connected with
again-becoming, accompanied by delight and passion, finding delight in this and
that, that is to say: craving for sense-pleasures, craving for becoming,
craving for de-becoming.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.21" href="#Kd.1.6.21"></a>
“And this, monks, is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the stopping of ill: the utter and passionless stopping of that very
craving, its renunciation, surrender, release, the lack of pleasure in it.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.22" href="#Kd.1.6.22"></a>
“And this, monks, is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the course leading to the stopping of ill: this aryan eightfold Way
itself, that is to say: right view … right concentration. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.11" href="#Vin.1.11"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.23" href="#Kd.1.6.23"></a>
On thinking, ‘This is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of ill’, among things not heard before by me, monks, vision arose,
knowledge arose, wisdom arose, higher knowledge arose, light arose. On
thinking, ‘Now that which is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of ill must be completely known’ … ‘Now that which is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of ill is completely known’, among things not heard before by me, monks,
vision arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, higher knowledge arose, light
arose.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.24" href="#Kd.1.6.24"></a>
“On thinking, ‘This is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the uprising of ill’ … light arose. On thinking, ‘Now that which is
this <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.17" href="#BD.4.17"></a>
<i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the uprising of ill must be given up’ … ‘… is given up’ … light
arose.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.25" href="#Kd.1.6.25"></a>
“On thinking, ‘This is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the stopping of ill’ … light arose. On thinking, ‘Now that which is
this <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the stopping of ill must be realized’ … ‘… is realised’ … light
arose.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.26" href="#Kd.1.6.26"></a>
“On thinking, ‘This is the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the course going to the stopping of ill’ … light arose. On thinking,
‘Now that which is this <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truth of the course leading to the stopping of ill must be made to become’ …
‘… is made to become’ … light arose.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.27" href="#Kd.1.6.27"></a>
“And so long, monks, the vision of knowledge of these four <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truths, with the three sections and twelve modes as they really are, was not
well purified by me, so long was I, monks, not thoroughly awakened with the
supreme full awakening as to the world with its <i lang="pi">devas</i>, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, with its recluses and brahmins, its
creatures with <i lang="pi">devas</i> and men. This I knew.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.28" href="#Kd.1.6.28"></a>
“But when, monks, the vision of knowledge of these four <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> truths, with the three sections and twelve modes as they really are, was well
purified by me, then was I, monks, thoroughly awakened with the supreme full
awakening as to the world … with its recluses and brahmins, its creatures with
<i lang="pi">devas</i> and men. This I knew.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.29" href="#Kd.1.6.29"></a>
“Moreover, the vision of knowledge arose in me: ‘Freedom of mind is for me
unshakeable, this the last birth, there is not now again-becoming.’” Thus spoke
the Lord; delighted, the group of five monks rejoiced in the Lord’s utterance.
Moreover, while this discourse was being uttered, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the venerable Koṇḍañña that “whatever is
of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.30" href="#Kd.1.6.30"></a>
And when the Lord had rolled the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-wheel, the earth <i lang="pi">devas</i> made this sound heard:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.12" href="#Vin.1.12"></a>
“The supreme <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-wheel rolled thus by the Lord at Benares in the deer-park at
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.18" href="#BD.4.18"></a>
Isipatana cannot be rolled back by a recluse or brahmin or deva or by Māra or
by Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” Having heard the sound of the earth <i lang="pi">devas</i>, the <i lang="pi">devas</i> of the Four Great Kings made this sound heard … the Thirty <i lang="pi">devas</i> … Yama’s <i lang="pi">devas</i> … the Happy <i lang="pi">devas</i> … the <i lang="pi">devas</i> who delight in creation … the <i lang="pi">devas</i> who delight in the creation of others … the <i lang="pi">devas</i> of Brahmā’s retinue made this sound heard: “The supreme <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-wheel rolled thus by the Lord at Benares in the deer-park at Isipatana cannot
be rolled back by a recluse or brahmin or <i lang="pi">deva</i> or by Māra or by Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.31" href="#Kd.1.6.31"></a>
In this wise in that moment, in that second, in that instant, the sound reached
as far as the Brahma-world, and the ten thousandfold world-system trembled,
quaked, shook violently and a radiance, splendid, measureless, surpassing the <i lang="pi">devas</i>’ own glory, was manifest in the world. Then the Lord uttered this solemn
utterance: “Indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood, indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood.”
Thus it was that Aññata Koṇḍañña became the venerable Koṇḍañña’s name.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.32" href="#Kd.1.6.32"></a>
Then the venerable Aññata Koṇḍañña, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, plunged into <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having crossed over doubt, having put away uncertainty, having attained
without another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke
thus to the Lord: “May I, Lord, receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence,
may I receive ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monk,” the Lord said, “well taught is
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.19" href="#BD.4.19"></a>
Fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this came to be this
venerable one’s ordination.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.33" href="#Kd.1.6.33"></a>
Then the Lord exhorted, instructed those remaining monks with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Then while they were being exhorted, instructed by the Lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the venerable Vappa and to the venerable
Bhaddiya, that “whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature
to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.34" href="#Kd.1.6.34"></a>
These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … having attained without another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s
instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: “May we, Lord, receive the going forth in
the Lord’s presence, may we receive ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well taught is
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, fare
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.13" href="#Vin.1.13"></a>
the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this came to be these
venerable ones’ ordination.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.35" href="#Kd.1.6.35"></a>
Then the Lord, eating the food brought back by these, exhorted, instructed
those remaining monks with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, saying: “Let the group of six live on whatever the three monks bring
when they have walked for almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.36" href="#Kd.1.6.36"></a>
Then while they were being exhorted, instructed by the Lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the venerable Mahānāma and to the
venerable Assaji, that “whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the
nature to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.37" href="#Kd.1.6.37"></a>
These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … having attained without another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s
instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: “May we, Lord, receive the going forth in
the Lord’s presence, may we receive ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well taught is
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.20" href="#BD.4.20"></a>
this came to be these venerable ones’ ordination.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.38" href="#Kd.1.6.38"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the group of five monks, saying: “Body, monks, is not
self. Now were this body self, monks this body would not tend to sickness, and
one might get the chance of saying in regard to body, ‘Let body become thus for
me, let body not become thus for me’. But inasmuch, monks, as body is not self,
therefore body tends to sickness, and one does not get the chance of saying in
regard to body, ‘Let body become thus for me, let body not become thus for
me’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.39" href="#Kd.1.6.39"></a>
Feeling is not self … and one does not get the chance of saying in regard to
feeling, ‘Let feeling become thus for me, let feeling not become thus for me’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.40" href="#Kd.1.6.40"></a>
“Perception is not self … The habitual tendencies are not self … one does not
get the chance of saying in regard to the habitual tendencies, ‘Let the
habitual tendencies become thus for me, let the habitual tendencies not become
thus for me’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.41" href="#Kd.1.6.41"></a>
“Consciousness is not self …
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.14" href="#Vin.1.14"></a>
… Inasmuch, monks, as consciousness is not self, therefore consciousness tends
to sickness, and one does not get the chance to say in regard to consciousness,
‘Let consciousness become such for me, let consciousness not become thus for
me.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.42" href="#Kd.1.6.42"></a>
What do you think about this, monks? Is body permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p>“Impermanent, Lord.”</p>
<p>“But is that which is impermanent painful or pleasurable?”</p>
<p>“Painful, Lord.”</p>
<p>“But is it fit to consider that which is impermanent, painful, of a nature to
change, as ‘This is mine, this am I, this is my self’?”</p>
<p>“It is not Lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.43" href="#Kd.1.6.43"></a>
“Is feeling … perception … are the habitual tendencies … is consciousness
permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.21" href="#BD.4.21"></a>
“Impermanent, Lord.”</p>
<p>“But is that which is impermanent painful or pleasurable?”</p>
<p>“Painful, Lord.”</p>
<p>“But is it (it to consider that which is impermanent, painful of a nature to
change, as ‘This is mine, this am I, this is my self’?”</p>
<p>“It is not so, Lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.44" href="#Kd.1.6.44"></a>
“Wherefore, monks, whatever is body, past, future, present or internal or
external, or gross or subtle, or low or excellent whether it is far or near—all
body should, by means of right wisdom, be seen, as it really is, thus: This is
not mine, this am I not, this is not my self.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.45" href="#Kd.1.6.45"></a>
“Whatever is feeling … whatever is perception … whatever are the habitual
tendencies … whatever is consciousness past, future, present, or internal or
external, or gross or subtle, or low or excellent, whether far or near—all
consciousness should, by means of right wisdom, be seen as it really is, thus:
This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my self.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.46" href="#Kd.1.6.46"></a>
“Seeing in this way, monks, the instructed disciple of the ariyans disregards
body and he disregards feeling and he disregards perception and he disregards
the habitual tendencies and he disregards consciousness; disregarding he is
dispassionate; through dispassion he is freed; in freedom the knowledge comes
to be: ‘I am freed’, and he knows: Destroyed is birth, lived is the
Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such or
such.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.6.47" href="#Kd.1.6.47"></a>
Thus spoke the Lord; delighted, the group of five monks rejoiced in what the
Lord had said. Moreover while this discourse was being uttered, the minds of
the group of five monks were freed from the cankers without grasping. At that
time there were six perfected ones in the world.</p>
<p class="end">The First Portion for Recital. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.15" href="#Vin.1.15"></a>
</p>
<h2>On the going forth of Yasa</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs=empty" id="Kd.1.7"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.1" href="#Kd.1.7.1"></a>
At that time in Benares there was a young man of family, the son of a (great)
merchant, delicately reared, called Yasa.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.22" href="#BD.4.22"></a>
He had three mansions, one for the cold weather, one for the hot weather, one
for the rains. Being ministered to by bands of female musicians for four months
in the mansion for the rains, he did not come down from that mansion. Then
while Yasa, the young man of family, was possessed of and provided with the
five kinds of sense-pleasures, and was being ministered to, he fell asleep
first and his suite fell asleep after him, and an oil lamp was burning all
through the night.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.2" href="#Kd.1.7.2"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, having awoken first saw his own suite
sleeping, one with a lute in the hollow of her arm, one with a tabor at her
neck, one with a drum in the hollow of her arm, one with dishevelled hair, one
with saliva dripping from her mouth, muttering in their sleep, like a cemetery
before his very eyes. Seeing this, its peril grew plain, and his mind was set
on disregarding it. Then Yasa, the young man of family, uttered a solemn
utterance: “What distress indeed, what affliction indeed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.3" href="#Kd.1.7.3"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, having put on his golden sandals,
approached the door of the dwelling. Non-human beings opened the door,
thinking: “Let there be no obstacle for the going forth from home into
homelessness of Yasa, the young man of family.” Then Yasa, the young man of
family, approached the city-door. Non-human beings opened the door, thinking:
“Let there be no obstacle for the going forth from home into homelessness of
Yasa, the young man of family.” Then Yasa, the young man of family, approached
the deer-park at Isipatana.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.4" href="#Kd.1.7.4"></a>
At that time, the Lord having risen in the night towards dawn, was pacing up
and down in the open air. The Lord saw Yasa, the young man of family, coming in
the distance: seeing him, having come down from (the place) where he was pacing
up and down, he sat down on an appointed seat. Then Yasa, the young man of
family, when he was near, uttered this solemn utterance to the Lord: “What
distress indeed, what affliction <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.23" href="#BD.4.23"></a>
indeed.” Then the Lord spoke thus to Yasa, the young man of family: “This,
Yasa, is not distress, this, Yasa, is not affliction. Come, sit down, Yasa, I
will teach you <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.5" href="#Kd.1.7.5"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, thinking: “It is said that this is not
distress, that this is not affliction”, exultant and uplifted, having taken off
his golden sandals, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the
Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the Lord talked a progressive talk to Yasa, the young man
of family, that is to say, talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven,
he explained the peril, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures of the senses,
the advantage in renouncing them.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.6" href="#Kd.1.7.6"></a>
When the Lord
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.16" href="#Vin.1.16"></a>
knew that the mind of Yasa, the young man of family, was ready, malleable,
devoid of hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to him the teaching
on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> which the awakened ones have themselves discovered: ill, uprising, stopping,
the Way. And just as a clean cloth without black specks will take a dye easily,
even so (as he was sitting) on that very seat, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to Yasa, the young man of family, that
whatever is of a nature to uprise, all that is of a nature to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.7" href="#Kd.1.7.7"></a>
Then the mother of Yasa, the young man of family, having mounted up to the
mansion, not seeing Yasa, the young man of family, approached the (great)
merchant, the householder; having approached she spoke thus to the (great)
merchant, the householder; “Householder, your son, Yasa, is not to be seen.”
Then the (great) merchant, the householder, having dispatched messengers on
horse-back to the four quarters, himself approached the deer-park at Isipatana.
The (great) merchant, the householder, saw the prints of golden sandals, and
seeing them he followed them along.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.8" href="#Kd.1.7.8"></a>
The Lord saw the (great) merchant, the householder, coming
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.24" href="#BD.4.24"></a>
in the distance; seeing him, it occurred to the Lord: “Suppose I were to
perform such a psychic wonder that the (great) merchant, the householder,
sitting here, should not see Yasa the young man of family, sitting here?” Then
the Lord performed such a psychic wonder.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.9" href="#Kd.1.7.9"></a>
Then the (great) merchant, the householder, approached the Lord; having
approached he spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord has the Lord not seen Yasa, the
young man of family?”</p>
<p>“Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see Yasa, the
young man of family, sitting here.”</p>
<p>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, thinking: “It is said that I,
sitting here, will see Yasa, the young man of family, sitting here”, and
exultant, uplifted, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful
distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.10" href="#Kd.1.7.10"></a>
As the (great) merchant, the householder was sitting down at a respectful
distance, the Lord talked a progressive talk … attained without the help of
another to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the
Lord: “Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Just as one might set upright what has
been upset, or might uncover what was concealed, or might show the way to one
who is astray, or might bring an oil lamp into the darkness, thinking, ‘Those
with eyes may see shapes’, even so is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> explained in many a figure by the Lord. I myself go to the Lord as refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and to the Order of monks. Let the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple gone for
refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts.” Thus he came to be the

using the three-word formula.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.11" href="#Kd.1.7.11"></a>
Then while the father of Yasa, the young man of family, was being taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge) as it was seen, as it was known,
his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Then it occurred to the
Lord: “While the father of Yasa, the young man of family, was being taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge) as it was seen, as it was known,
his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now Yasa, the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.25" href="#BD.4.25"></a>
young man of family, cannot become one, having turned back to the low life, to
enjoy pleasures of the senses as he did formerly when leading a household life.
Suppose I were to annul that psychic wonder?” Then the Lord annulled that
psychic wonder.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.12" href="#Kd.1.7.12"></a>
Then the (great) merchant, the householder, saw Yasa, the young man of family
sitting down; seeing him, he spoke thus to Yasa, the young man of family: “Dear
Yasa, your mother is full of lamentation and grief, give your mother life.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.13" href="#Kd.1.7.13"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, looked towards the Lord. Then the Lord
spoke thus to the (great) merchant, the householder: “What do you think about
this, house-holder, that <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> was seen by Yasa with a learner’s knowledge, with a learner’s insight, even as
by you? As he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge), as it was seen, as it was
known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now can Yasa,
householder, having turned back to the low life, become one to enjoy pleasures
of the senses, as he did formerly when leading a household life?”</p>
<p>“No, Lord.”</p>
<p>“<i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> was seen by Yasa, the young man of family, householder, with a learner’s
knowledge, with a learner’s insight, even as by you. As he was reviewing his
stage (of knowledge), as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from
the cankers without grasping. Now Yasa, the young man of family, householder,
cannot become one, having turned back to the low life, to enjoy pleasures of
the senses, as he did formerly when leading a household life.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.14" href="#Kd.1.7.14"></a>
“Lord, it is a gain for Yasa, the young man of family, Lord, it is well gotten
for Yasa, the young man of family, inasmuch as the mind of Yasa, the young man
of family, is freed from the cankers without grasping. Lord, may the Lord
consent to a meal with me on the morrow with Yasa, the young man of family, as
his attendant?” The Lord consented by becoming silent. Then the (great)
merchant, the householder, knowing that the Lord had consented, rising from his
seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.7.15" href="#Kd.1.7.15"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, soon after the (great)
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.26" href="#BD.4.26"></a>
merchant, the householder, had departed, spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, may I
receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may I receive ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monk,” the Lord said, “well preached is
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Lead the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.18" href="#Vin.1.18"></a>
came to be that venerable one’s ordination. At that time there were seven
perfected ones in the world.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.8"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.8.1" href="#Kd.1.8.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe,
approached the dwelling of the (great) merchant, the householder, with the
venerable Yasa as attendant; having approached, he sat down on an appointed
seat. Then the mother and the former wife of the venerable Yasa approached the
Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful
distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.8.2" href="#Kd.1.8.2"></a>
The Lord talked a progressive talk to these, that is to say, talk on giving,
talk on moral habit, talk on heaven … <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them that, “whatever is of a nature to
uprise, all that is of a nature to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.8.3" href="#Kd.1.8.3"></a>
These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … spoke thus to the Lord: “Excellent Lord! … we ourselves, Lord, go to the
Lord as refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to the Order of monks. Let the Lord accept us as women lay-disciples, gone
for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts.” Thus these were the
first women lay-disciples in the world using the three-word formula.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.8.4" href="#Kd.1.8.4"></a>
Then the venerable Yasa’s mother and father and former wife, having with their
own hand(s) served the Lord and the venerable Yasa and having offered them
sumptuous foods, solid and soft, sat down when the Lord had finished his meal
and had removed his hand from the bowl. Then the Lord, having gladdened,
roused, rejoiced, delighted the venerable Yasa’s mother and father and former
wife with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat departed.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.9.1" href="#Kd.1.9.1"></a>
Four householder friends of the venerable Yasa, young men of families of
(great) merchants and lesser (great) merchants <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.27" href="#BD.4.27"></a>
in Benares, Vimala,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.19" href="#Vin.1.19"></a>
Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, Gavampati, heard: “They say that Yasa, the young man of
family, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on yellow robes, has gone
forth from home into homelessness.” Having heard this, it occurred to them:
“Now this can be no ordinary <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, nor can this be an ordinary going forth, in that Yasa, the
young man of family, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on the
yellow robes, has gone forth from home into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.9.2" href="#Kd.1.9.2"></a>
These four people approached the venerable Yasa; having approached, having
greeted the venerable Yasa, they stood at a respectful distance. Then the
venerable Yasa, taking these four householder friends, approached the Lord;
having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Yasa
spoke thus to the Lord: “These four householder friends of mine, Lord, young
men of families of (great) merchants and lesser (great) merchants in Benares,
Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, Gavampati, may the Lord exhort, may he instruct these
four.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.9.3" href="#Kd.1.9.3"></a>
The Lord talked a progressive talk to these, that is to say, talk on giving,
talk on moral habit, talk on heaven … <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them that “whatever is of the nature to
uprise, all that is of the nature to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.9.4" href="#Kd.1.9.4"></a>
These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, may we receive the going forth in the Lord’s

<p>“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well preached is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this came to be
these venerable ones’ ordination. Then the Lord exhorted, instructed these
monks with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> talk. While they were being exhorted, instructed by the Lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> talk, their minds were freed from the cankers without grasping. At that time
there were eleven perfected ones in the world.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.11"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.11.1" href="#Kd.1.11.1"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “I, monks, am freed from all snares,
both those of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and those of men. And you,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.21" href="#Vin.1.21"></a>
monks, are freed from all snares, both those of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and those of men. Walk, monks, on tour for the blessing of the manyfolk, for
the happiness of the manyfolk out of compassion for the world, for the welfare,
the blessing, the happiness of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and men. Let not two (of you) go by one (way.) Monks, teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> which is lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending.
Explain with the spirit and the letter the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled,
wholly pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes, who, not hearing
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, are decaying, (but) if they are learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow. And I, monks, will go along to Uruvelā, to the Camp township,
in order to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.11.2" href="#Kd.1.11.2"></a>
Then Māra, the Evil One, approached the Lord; having approached, he addressed
the Lord with verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Bound art thou by all the snares,<br>
Both those of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and of men, <br>
In great bondage art thou bound,<br>
Recluse, thou’lt not be freed from me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.29" href="#BD.4.29"></a>
“Freed am I from all the snares,<br>
Both those of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and of men,<br>
From great bondage am I freed,<br>
Humbled art thou, O End-maker.”</p>
<p>“The tale of mind-impressions is a snare <br>
That weaves its tallies to and fro in air. <br>
With these will I have wherewith to fetter thee,<br>
Recluse, thou wilt not be freed from me.”</p>
<p>“Sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and things to touch,<br>
Bringing delights to mind of man-for such<br>
All wish, all will, for me is past and gone,<br>
Humbled art thou, O End-maker.”</p>

<p>Then Māra, the Evil One, thinking, “The Lord knows me, the well-farer knows

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.12"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.12.1" href="#Kd.1.12.1"></a>
At that time monks brought (to the Lord) from various quarters, from various
districts those wishing for the going forth, those wishing for ordination,
thinking: “The Lord will let these go forth, he will ordain them.” Thereby both
the monks as well as those wishing for the going forth and those wishing for
ordination were tired. Then a reasoning arose in the Lord’s mind as he was
meditating in seclusion, thus: “At present monks are bringing (to me) from
various quarters … and those wishing for ordination are tired. Suppose I were
to allow it to monks, saying: ‘You, monks, may now yourselves let go forth, may
ordain in any quarter, in any district’?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.12.2" href="#Kd.1.12.2"></a>
Then the Lord, emerging from seclusion towards evening, on this occasion, in
this connection, having given reasoned talk, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.22" href="#Vin.1.22"></a>
addressed the monks, saying: “While I was meditating in seclusion, monks, a
reasoning arose in my mind, thus: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.30" href="#BD.4.30"></a>
‘At present monks are bringing … in any quarter, in any district’?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.12.3" href="#Kd.1.12.3"></a>
“I allow, monks, that you yourselves may now let go forth may ordain in any
quarter, in any district. And thus, monks, should one let go forth, should one
ordain: First, having made him have his hair and beard cut off, having made him
put on yellow robes, having made him arrange an upper robe over one shoulder,
having made him honour the monks’ feet, having made him sit down on his
haunches, having made him salute with joined palms, he should be told: <span class="kamma">‘Speak thus: <a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.12.4" href="#Kd.1.12.4"></a>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.13"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.13.1" href="#Kd.1.13.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having kept the rains, addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, by
proper attention, by proper right effort was supreme freedom attained by me,
supreme freedom realised. You, too, monks, by proper attention, by proper right
effort may attain supreme freedom, may realise supreme freedom.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.13.2" href="#Kd.1.13.2"></a>

<h2>The story of the excellent group</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.14"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.14.1" href="#Kd.1.14.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Benares for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Uruvelā. Then the Lord, turning off from the road, approached a
certain woodland grove; having approached, having plunged into that woodland
grove, he sat down at the root of a certain tree. At that time a group of as
many as thirty friends of high standing, with their wives, were amusing
themselves in that same woodland grove. One had no wife, (so) a woman of low
standing was brought along for him. Then while they were heedlessly amusing
themselves that woman of low standing, taking (their) belongings, ran away.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.14.2" href="#Kd.1.14.2"></a>
Then these friends, doing their friend a service and seeking for that woman,
roaming about that woodland grove, saw the Lord sitting at the root of a
certain tree; seeing him, they approached the Lord, having approached, they
spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, has the Lord not seen a woman?”</p>
<p>“But what have you, young men, to do with a woman?”</p>
<p>“We, Lord, a group of as many as thirty friends of high standing, with our
wives, were amusing ourselves in this woodland grove; one had no wife, (so) a
woman of low standing was brought along for him. Then, Lord, as we were
heedlessly amusing ourselves, that woman of low standing, taking our
belongings, ran away. Consequently, Lord, we friends, doing our friend a
service and seeking for that woman, are roaming about this woodland grove.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.14.3" href="#Kd.1.14.3"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.32" href="#BD.4.32"></a>
“What do you think of this, young men? Which is better for you, that you should
seek for a woman or that you should seek for the self?”</p>
<p>“Truly this were better for us, Lord, that we should seek for the self.”</p>
<p>“Well then, young men, you sit down, I will teach you <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p>Saying, “Yes, Lord,” this group of friends of high standing, having greeted the
Lord, sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.14.4" href="#Kd.1.14.4"></a>
The Lord talked a progressive talk to these, that is to say, talk on giving,
talk on moral habit, talk on heaven … that “whatever is of the nature to
uprise, all that is of the nature to stop.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.14.5" href="#Kd.1.14.5"></a>
These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, plunged into <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.24" href="#Vin.1.24"></a>
… spoke thus to the Lord: “May we, Lord, receive the going forth in the Lord’s
presence, may we receive ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well taught is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this came to be
these venerable ones’ ordination.</p>

Told is the Case of the Group of Friends of High Standing.</p>
<p class="end">The Second Portion for Repeating.</p>
<h2>On the miracles at Uruvelā</h2>
<p>Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Uruvelā. Now at that
time three matted hair ascetics, Kassapa of Uruvelā, Kassapa of the River,
Kassapa of Gayā, were living at Uruvelā. Of these, the matted hair ascetic
Kassapa of Uruvelā was leader, guide, highest, chief, head of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.33" href="#BD.4.33"></a>
five hundred matted hair ascetics; the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of the River
was leader … head of three hundred matted hair ascetics; the matted hair
ascetic Kassapa of Gayā was leader … head of two hundred matted hair ascetics.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.15"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.2" href="#Kd.1.15.2"></a>
Then the Lord approached the hermitage of the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of
Uruvelā; having approached, he spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of
Uruvelā: “If it is not inconvenient to you, Kassapa, let me stay for one night
in the fire-room.”</p>
<p>“It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, (but) there is a fierce serpent
king of psychic power there; he is a terribly venomous snake. Do not let him
harm you.” And a second time the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic
Kassapa of Uruvelā: “If it is not inconvenient to you …” And a third time the
Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: “If it is not
inconvenient to you, Kassapa, let me stay for one night in the fire-room.”</p>
<p>“It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, (but) there is a fierce serpent
king of psychic power there; he is a terribly venomous snake. Do not let him
harm you.”</p>
<p>“It is not likely that he can harm me. Please do you, Kassapa, allow (me the
use of) the fire-room,”</p>
<p>“Stay, great recluse, as you wish it.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.3" href="#Kd.1.15.3"></a>
Then the Lord, having entered the fire-room, having laid down a grass mat, sat
down cross-legged, keeping his back erect, having caused mindfulness to be
present in front of him. Then that serpent saw that the Lord had entered, and
seeing this, pained, afflicted, he blew forth smoke. Then it occurred to the
Lord: “What now if I, without destroying this serpent’s <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.25" href="#Vin.1.25"></a>
skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and the marrow of the bones,
were to master (his) heat by heat?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.4" href="#Kd.1.15.4"></a>
Then the Lord, having worked a work of psychic power, blew forth smoke. Then
that serpent, not conquering anger, blazed up. The Lord, having attained the
condition of heat, also blazed up. When both were in flames, the fire-room
became as though burning, ablaze, in flames. Then the matted hair ascetics,
having surrounded the fire-room, spoke thus: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.34" href="#BD.4.34"></a>
“Beautiful indeed is the great recluse, (but) he will be harmed by the
serpent.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.5" href="#Kd.1.15.5"></a>
Then the Lord at the end of that night, without having destroyed that serpent’s
skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and the marrow of the bones,
having mastered (his) heat by heat, having placed him in his bowl, showed him
to the matted hair ascetic, Uruvelākassapa, saying: “This, Kassapa, is your
serpent, his heat was mastered by heat.” Then it occurred to the matted hair
ascetic Uruvelākassapa: “Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of
great majesty, in that he can master by heat the heat of the fierce serpent
king who has psychic power and is a terribly venomous snake; but yet he is not
a perfected one as I am.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.6" href="#Kd.1.15.6"></a>
Near the Nerañjarā, the Lord <br>
spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelākassapa: <br>
“If it is not inconvenient to you, Kassapa, <br>
let me stay this day (only) in the fire-hall.”</p>
<p>“It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, <br>
(but) as I am anxious for your comfort I warn you <br>
that there is a fierce serpent king there, <br>
of psychic power, a terribly venomous snake. <br>
Do not let him harm you.”</p>
<p>“It is not likely that he can harm me. <br>
Please do you, Kassapa, allow (me the use of) the fire-room.”<br>
“It is given”; having understood this, <br>
the fearless one entered, fear overpassed.</p>
<p>Having seen that the holy man had entered,
<br>
the chief of snakes, afflicted, blew forth smoke. <br>
The chief of men, joyful, unperturbed, <br>
blew forth smoke there
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.35" href="#BD.4.35"></a>
too.</p>
<p>But the chief of snakes, not conquering anger, <br>
blazed up like a fire. <br>
The chief of men, highly proficient in the condition of heat, <br>
blazed up there too.</p>
<p>When both were in flames, <br>
the matted hair ascetics, as they were looking at the fire-room, said: <br>
“Beautiful indeed is the great recluse, <br>
(but) he will be harmed by the serpent.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.7" href="#Kd.1.15.7"></a>
Then at the end of that night <br>
the serpent’s flames became extinguished, <br>
but the multicoloured flames of him of psychic power remained, <br>
and multicoloured flames, dark green, <br>
then red, crimson, yellow and crystal-coloured <br>
were on Angirasa’s body.</p>
<p>Having put the chief of snakes into his bowl, <br>
he showed him to the brahmin, saying: <br>
“This, Kassapa, is your serpent, <br>
his heat was mastered by heat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, thoroughly believing in this
wonder of psychic power of the Lord, spoke thus to the Lord: “Stay just here,
great recluse, I (can offer you) a constant supply of food.”</p>
<p class="end"><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.15.8" href="#Kd.1.15.8"></a>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.16.1" href="#Kd.1.16.1"></a>
Then the Lord stayed in a certain woodland grove near the hermitage of the
matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa. Then the four Great Kings, having illumined
the entire woodland grove on a glorious night with glorious colour, approached
the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they stood at the four
quarters like huge fires.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.16.2" href="#Kd.1.16.2"></a>
Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of
that night, and having approached he spoke thus to the Lord: “It is time, great
recluse, the meal is ready. But now, who were these, great recluse, who, having
illumined the entire woodland grove during the glorious night with glorious
colour, approached you and having approached, having greeted you, stood at the
four quarters like huge fires?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.36" href="#BD.4.36"></a>
“Kassapa, these were the four Great Kings who approached me in order to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p>Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelākassapa: “Truly the great
recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that the four Great Kings
also approach him in order to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord, having eaten the meal (offered by) the matted hair ascetic
Uruvelākassapa, stayed in that same woodland grove.</p>
<p class="end"><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.16.3" href="#Kd.1.16.3"></a>
The Second Wonder.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.17"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.17.1" href="#Kd.1.17.1"></a>
Then Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, having illumined the entire woodland grove on a glorious night with glorious
colour, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he
stood at a respectful distance, like a huge fire, more glorious and more superb
than the former splendours of colour.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.17.2" href="#Kd.1.17.2"></a>
Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of
that night … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd1#Kd.1.16.2">Kd.1.16.2</a></span>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.27" href="#Vin.1.27"></a>

Then Brahmā Sahampati …
<span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd1#Kd.1.17">Kd.1.17</a></span> … stayed in that same woodland grove.</p>

The Fourth Wonder.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.19"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.19.1" href="#Kd.1.19.1"></a>
Now at that time a great sacrifice (made by) the matted hair ascetic
Uruvelakassapa was going forward, and the entire (population of) Aṅga and
Magadha, taking abundant solid food and soft food, wanted to go (to it)). Then
it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: “At present my great
sacrifice is going forward, and the entire (population of) Aṅga and Magadha,
taking abundant solid food and soft food, will come. If the great recluse does
a wonder of psychic <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.37" href="#BD.4.37"></a>
power before the populace, the great recluse’s gains and honour will much
increase, my gains and honour will decline. Now the great recluse shall
certainly not come to-morrow.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.19.2" href="#Kd.1.19.2"></a>
Then the Lord,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.28" href="#Vin.1.28"></a>
knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of the matted hair ascetic
Uruvelakassapa, having gone to Uttarakuru, having fetched almsfood from there,
having eaten it by the Anotatta lake, took his midday rest there. Then at the
end of that night the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord;
having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord: “It is time, great recluse, the
meal is ready. But why did you not come yesterday, great recluse? We thought of
you however, saying‘How is it that the great recluse does not come?’ A portion
of solid food and soft food was put aside for you.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.19.3" href="#Kd.1.19.3"></a>
“Now did it not occur to you, Kassapa, ‘At present my great sacrifice is going
forward … Now the great recluse shall certainly not come to-morrow’?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.19.4" href="#Kd.1.19.4"></a>
“So I, Kassapa, knowing by mind the reasoning in your mind, having gone to
Uttarakuru, having fetched almsfood from there, having eaten it by the Anotatta
lake, took my mid-day rest there.” Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic
Uruvelakassapa, “Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great
might, in that he also knows mind by mind; but yet he is not a perfected one as
I am.” Then the Lord, having eaten the meal (offered by) the matted hair
ascetic Uruvelakassapa, stayed in that same woodland grove.</p>
<p class="end"><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.19.5" href="#Kd.1.19.5"></a>
The Fifth Wonder.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.20"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.1" href="#Kd.1.20.1"></a>
Now at that time a rag-robe accrued to the Lord. Then it occurred to the Lord:
“Now where can I wash the rag-robe?” Then Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, having dug a tank with his
hand, spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, the Lord may wash the rag-robe here.” Then
it occurred to the Lord: “Now on what can I knead the rag-robe?” Then Sakka,
lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, having
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.38" href="#BD.4.38"></a>
put down a large stone near him, said: “Lord, the Lord may knead the rag-robe
here.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.2" href="#Kd.1.20.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Now holding on to what can I come up from (the
water)?” Then a <i lang="pi">devatā</i> inhabiting a <i lang="pi">kakudha</i> (tree), knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, bent down a bough,
saying: “Lord, the Lord <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.29" href="#Vin.1.29"></a>
may come up from (the water) holding on here.” Then it occurred to the Lord:
“Now on what can I stretch out the rag-robe?” Then Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, having put down a large
stone near him said: “Lord, the Lord may stretch out the rag-robe here”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.3" href="#Kd.1.20.3"></a>
Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of
that night; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord: “It is time, great
recluse, the meal is ready. But how is it, great recluse, that this tank was
not here before, and now this tank is here? Nor was this stone put down before.
By whom was this stone put down? Nor was a bough of this <i lang="pi">kakudha</i> (tree) bent down before, and now this bough is bent down.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.4" href="#Kd.1.20.4"></a>
“Kassapa, a rag-robe accrued to me here, and this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now
where can I wash the rag-robe? ‘Then, Kassapa, Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, knowing by mind the reasoning in my mind, having dug a tank with his hand,
spoke thus to me: ‘Lord, the Lord may wash the rag-robe here.’ So this tank was
dug by the hand of a non-human being. Then this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now
on what can I knead the rag-robe? “… So this stone was put by a non-human
being.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.5" href="#Kd.1.20.5"></a>
Then this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now holding on to what can I come up out of
(the water)?’ Then, Kassapa, a <i lang="pi">devatā</i> … said: ‘Lord, the Lord may come up from (the water) holding on here.’ So this
<i lang="pi">kakudha</i> (tree) was a hold for my hand. Then this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now on what
can I stretch out the rag-robe?’ Then Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i> … So this stone was put by a non-human being.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.6" href="#Kd.1.20.6"></a>
Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: “Truly the great
recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, does him a service; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am.” Then the
Lord, having eaten the meal (offered by) the matted hair ascetic
Uruvelākassapa, stayed in that same woodland grove.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.7" href="#Kd.1.20.7"></a>
Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of
that night; having approached, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.30" href="#Vin.1.30"></a>
he announced the time to the Lord, saying: “It is time, great recluse, the meal
is ready.”</p>
<p>“You go on, Kassapa, I am coming along,” and having dismissed the matted hair
ascetic Uruvelakassapa, having plucked a fruit from a rose-apple tree, after
which this Land of the Rose-apples is named, he sat down in the fire-room,
having arrived first.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.8" href="#Kd.1.20.8"></a>
The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord sitting in the fire-room;
seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: “By what way have you come, great
recluse? I set out before you, but you are sitting in the fire-room, having
arrived first.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.9" href="#Kd.1.20.9"></a>
“Now I, Kassapa, having dismissed you, having plucked a fruit from a rose-apple
tree, after which this Land of the Rose-apples is named, am sitting in the
fire-room, having arrived first. Truly, Kassapa, this rose-apple fruit is full
of colour, full of scent, full of flavor; if you like, do eat it.”</p>
<p>“No, great recluse, you alone are worthy of it, you alone eat it.” Then it
occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: “Truly the great recluse is
of great psychic power, of great might, in that having dismissed me first … he
sat down in the fire-room, having arrived first; but yet he is not a perfected
one as I am.” Then the Lord, having eaten the meal (offered by) the matted hair
ascetic Uruvelakassapa, stayed in that same woodland grove.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.10" href="#Kd.1.20.10"></a>
Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa approached the Lord at the end of
that night; having approached he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.40" href="#BD.4.40"></a>
announced the time to the Lord, saying: “It is time, great recluse, the meal is
ready.”</p>
<p>“You go on, Kassapa, I am coming along,” and having dismissed the matted hair
ascetic Uruvelakassapa, and having plucked a mango fruit not far from the
rose-apple tree, after which this Land of the Rose-apples is named … having
plucked a fruit of emblic myrobalan not far from the mango tree … having
plucked a fruit of yellow myrobalan not far from the emblic myrobalan, having
gone to the Thirty, having plucked a flower from the Coral Tree, he sat down in
the fire-room, having arrived first. The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw
the Lord sitting in the fire-room, and seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord:
“By what way have you come, great recluse? I set out before you, but you are
sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.11" href="#Kd.1.20.11"></a>
“Now I, Kassapa, having dismissed you, having gone to the Thirty, having
plucked a flower from the Coral Tree, am sitting in the fire-room, having
arrived first. Truly, Kassapa, this flower of the Coral Tree is full of colour,
full of scent; if you like, do take it.”</p>
<p>“No, great recluse, you alone are worthy of it, you alone <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.31" href="#Vin.1.31"></a>
take it.” Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: “Truly
the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that having
dismissed me first, having gone to the Thirty, having plucked a flower from the
Coral Tree, he is sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first; but yet he is
not a perfected one as I am.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.12" href="#Kd.1.20.12"></a>
Now at that time these matted hair ascetics, wanting to tend the (sacred)
fires, were unable to chop sticks. Then it occurred to these matted hair
ascetics: “Doubtless it is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.41" href="#BD.4.41"></a>
(owing to) the psychic might of the great recluse that we are unable to chop
sticks.” Then the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa:
“Kassapa, let sticks be chopped.”</p>
<p>“Let them be chopped, great recluse.” Five hundred sticks were chopped
simultaneously. Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa:
“Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that
also sticks are chopped; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.13" href="#Kd.1.20.13"></a>
Now at that time these matted hair ascetics, wanting to tend the (sacred)
fires, were unable to kindle the fires. Then it occurred to these matted hair
ascetics: “Doubtless … unable to kindle the fires.” Then the Lord spoke thus to
the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: “Kassapa, let the fires be kindled.”</p>
<p>“Let them be kindled, great recluse.” Five hundred fires were kindled
simultaneously … “… in that also the fires are kindled; but yet he is not a
perfected one as I am.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.14" href="#Kd.1.20.14"></a>
Now at that time these matted hair ascetics, having tended the fires, were
unable to extinguish the fires. … The five hundred fires were extinguished
simultaneously … “… in that also the fires are extinguished; but yet he is not
a perfected one as I am.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.15" href="#Kd.1.20.15"></a>
Now at that time on the cold winter nights between the eights in a time of
snowfall these matted hair ascetics were plunging into the river Nerañjarā,
then emerging and repeatedly <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.42" href="#BD.4.42"></a>
plunging in and out. Then the Lord created as many as five hundred fire-vessels
just where these matted hair ascetics, having come up from (the river), warmed
themselves. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.32" href="#Vin.1.32"></a>
Then it occurred to these matted hair ascetics: “Doubtless it is (owing to) the
psychic might of the great recluse that these fire-vessels are created.” Then
it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: “Truly the great recluse
is of great psychic power, of great might, in that he can create these
fire-vessels; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.16" href="#Kd.1.20.16"></a>
Now at that time a great rain fell out of the proper season, and a great flood
resulted. The Lord was staying in a place which became inundated by water. Then
it occurred to the Lord: “Now suppose that I, having made the water recede all
round, should pace up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground?” Then the
Lord, having made the water recede all round, paced up and down in the middle
on dust-covered ground. Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, thinking:
“I hope that the great recluse has not been carried away by the water,” went
together with a boat and many matted hair ascetics to that place where the Lord
was staying. The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord who, having
made the water recede all round, was pacing up and down in the middle on
dust-covered ground, and seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: “Is it indeed
you who are here, great recluse?”</p>
<p>“It is I, Kassapa,” and the Lord having risen up above the ground, placed
himself in the boat. Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic
Uruvelakassapa: “Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great
might, in that also the water does not carry him away; but yet he is not a
perfected one as I am.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.17" href="#Kd.1.20.17"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: “Now, for a long time it will occur to this
foolish man, ‘Truly the great recluse is of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.43" href="#BD.4.43"></a>
great psychic power, of great might; but yet he is not a perfected one as I
am.’ Now, suppose I should deeply stir this matted hair ascetic?” Then the Lord
spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: “Neither are you,
Kassapa, a perfected one nor have you entered on the way to perfection, and
that course is not for you by which you either could be a perfected one or
could have entered on the way to perfection.” Then the matted hair ascetic
Kassapa of Uruvelā, having inclined his head to the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to
the Lord: “Lord, may I receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may I
receive ordination?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.18" href="#Kd.1.20.18"></a>
“It is you, Kassapa, who are leader, guide, highest, chief, head of five
hundred matted hair ascetics; do consult these so that they can do what they
think (right).” Then the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā approached
these matted hair ascetics; having approached, he spoke thus to these matted
hair ascetics: “I want, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.33" href="#Vin.1.33"></a>
good sirs, to fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse; let the revered
sirs do what they think (right).”</p>
<p>“For a long time we, good sir, have been much pleased by the great recluse; if,
revered sir, you will fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse, all of us
will fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.19" href="#Kd.1.20.19"></a>
Then these matted hair ascetics, having let their hair, their braids, their
bundles on the carrying-poles, their implements for fire-worship be carried
away all mixed up in the water, approached the Lord; having approached, having
inclined their heads to the Lord’s feet, they spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord,
may we receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may we receive
ordination?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.44" href="#BD.4.44"></a>
“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well taught is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this came to be
these venerable ones’ ordination.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.20" href="#Kd.1.20.20"></a>
The matted hair ascetic Kassapa of the River saw the hair the braids, the
bundles on the carrying-poles, the implements for fire-worship being carried
away all mixed up in the water; seeing this, it occurred to him: “I hope my
brother is not in danger,” and he dispatched matted hair ascetics saying: “Go
and find out about my brother,” and he himself with his three hundred matted
hair ascetics approached the venerable Kassapa of Uruvela; having approached he
spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa of Uruvela: “Is this better, Kassapa?”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend, this is better.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.21" href="#Kd.1.20.21"></a>
Then these matted hair ascetics … So this came to be these venerable ones’
ordination.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.22" href="#Kd.1.20.22"></a>
The matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Gayā saw the hair, the braids, the bundles
on the carrying-poles, the implements for fire-worship being carried away all
mixed up in the water; seeing this, it occurred to him: “I hope my brothers are
not in danger,” and he dispatched matted hair ascetics, saying: “Go and find
out about my brothers,” and he himself with his two hundred matted hair
ascetics approached the venerable Kassapa of Uruvela; having approached, he
spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa of Uruvelā: “Is this better, Kassapa?”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend, this is better.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.23" href="#Kd.1.20.23"></a>
Then these matted hair ascetics, having let their hair, their braids, their
bundles on the carrying-poles, their implements for fire-worship be carried
away all mixed up in the water, approached the Lord; having approached, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.34" href="#Vin.1.34"></a>
having inclined their heads to the Lord’s feet, they spoke thus to the Lord:
“Lord, may we receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may we receive
ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well taught is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this came to be
these venerable ones’ ordination.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.20.24" href="#Kd.1.20.24"></a>
Through the Lord’s psychic resolution, five hundred fire-sticks could not be
chopped, (and) were chopped; fires could not be kindled (and) were kindled;
could not be extinguished <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.45" href="#BD.4.45"></a>
(and) were extinguished; five hundred fire-vessels were created. In this way
there came to be three thousand five hundred marvels.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.21"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.21.1" href="#Kd.1.21.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Uruvelā for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Gayā Head together with a large Order of monks, with all those
same thousand monks who had formerly been matted hair ascetics. Then the Lord
stayed near Gayā at Gayā Head together with the thousand monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.21.2" href="#Kd.1.21.2"></a>
And there the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, everything is burning.
And what, monks, is everything that is burning? The eye, monks, is burning,
material shapes are burning, consciousness through the eye is burning,
impingement on the eye is burning, in other words the feeling which arises from
impingement on the eye, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor
pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? I say it is burning
with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of stupidity;
it is burning because of birth, ageing, dying, because of grief, sorrow,
suffering, lamentation and despair.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.21.3" href="#Kd.1.21.3"></a>
“The ear is burning, sounds are burning … the nose is burning, odours are
burning … the tongue is burning, tastes are burning … the body is burning,
tangible objects are burning …the mind is burning, mental states are burning,
consciousness through the mind is burning, impingement on the mind is burning,
in other words the feeling which raises through impingement on the mind, be it
pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too is burning. With
what is it burning? I say it is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire
of hatred, with the fire of stupidity; it is burning because of birth, ageing,
dying, because of grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.21.4" href="#Kd.1.21.4"></a>
“Seeing this, monks, the instructed disciple of the ariyans disregards the eye
and he disregards material shapes and he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.46" href="#BD.4.46"></a>
disregards consciousness through the eye and he disregards impingement on the
eye, in other words the feeling which arises from impingement on the eye, be it
pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too he disregards.
And he disregards the ear and he disregards sounds, and he disregards the nose
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.35" href="#Vin.1.35"></a>
and he disregards odours, and he disregards the tongue and he disregards
tastes, and he disregards the body and he disregards tangible objects, and he
disregards the mind and he disregards mental states and he disregards
consciousness through the mind and he disregards impingement on the mind, in
other words the feeling that arises from impingement on the mind, be it
pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too he disregards;
disregarding, he is dispassionate; through dispassion he is freed; in freedom
the knowledge comes to be, ‘I am freed’, and he comprehends: Destroyed is
birth, lived is the Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no
more of being such or such.”</p>
<p>And while this discourse was being uttered, the minds of these thousand monks
were freed from the cankers without grasping.</p>

Told is the Disquisition on Burning.</p>
<p class="end">Told is the Third Portion for Repeating: the Wonder(s) at Uruvelā.</p>
<h2>On Bimbisāra’s gathering</h2>
<p>Then the Lord, having stayed at Gayā Head for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Rājagaha together with the large Order of monks, with all those
same thousand monks who had formerly been matted hair ascetics. Then the Lord,
walking on tour, in due course arrived at Rājagaha. The Lord stayed there at
Rājagaha in the Palm Grove pleasure ground in the Supatiṭṭha shrine.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.22"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.2" href="#Kd.1.22.2"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: “Verily, the recluse Gotama, the
son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has reached
Rājagaha and is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.47" href="#BD.4.47"></a>
staying at Rājagaha in the Palm Grove pleasure ground in the Supatiṭṭha shrine.
A lovely reputation has gone forth concerning the Lord Gotama, thus: He is
indeed Lord, perfected one, fully awakened one, endowed with knowledge and
conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, unrivalled charioteer of men to be
tamed, teacher of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and mankind, awakened one, Lord. Having realised them by his own
super-knowledge, he makes known this world with its <i lang="pi">devas</i>, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, creatures with <i lang="pi">devas</i> and men, with recluses and brahmins. He teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending. He
explains with the spirit and the letter the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled
and wholly pure. Good indeed it were to see perfected ones like this.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.3" href="#Kd.1.22.3"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, surrounded by twelve myriad brahmins and
householders of Magadha, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Then some of these twelve
myriad <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.36" href="#Vin.1.36"></a>
brahmins and householders of Magadha having greeted the Lord, sat down at a
respectful distance; some exchanged greetings with the Lord, and having
exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, they sat down at a respectful
distance; some having saluted the Lord with joined palms, sat down at a
respectful distance; some having shouted out their name and clan before the
Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some having become silent, sat down at
a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.4" href="#Kd.1.22.4"></a>
Then it occurred to those twelve myriad brahmins and householders of Magadha:
“Now, does the great recluse fare the Brahma-faring under Kassapa of Uruvelā,
or does Kassapa of Uruvelā fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse?”
Then the Lord, knowing with his mind the reasoning in the minds of those twelve
myriad brahmins and householders of Magadha, addressed Kassapa of Uruvelā with
the verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.48" href="#BD.4.48"></a>
“What hast thou seen, O dweller in Uruvelā,<br>
That thou, known as emaciate, hast abandoned the (sacred) fire?<br>
I ask thee about this matter, Kassapa:<br>
Hast thou abandoned thy fire-implements?”
</p>
<p>“The sacrifices speak of forms and sounds, <br>
Also of tastes, pleasures and women. <br>
Knowing that ‘This is dross’ among affections—<br>
Therefore I delighted not in sacrifice, in offering.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.5" href="#Kd.1.22.5"></a>
“But if your mind delights not there, Kassapa,” the Lord said,<br>
“Among forms, sounds and also tastes,<br>
Then in the world of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and men what does your mind delight in?<br>
Kassapa, tell me that.”
</p>
<p>“When I had seen the path, peaceful, without substrate,<br>
Stainless, not attached to sensations’ becoming,<br>
Not becoming otherwise, where one cannot be led by others—<br>
In consequence, I delighted not in sacrifice, in offering.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.6" href="#Kd.1.22.6"></a>
Then the venerable Kassapa of Uruvelā, rising from his seat, having arranged
his upper robe over one shoulder, having inclined his head towards the Lord’s
feet, spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple;
Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple.” Then it occurred to those
twelve myriad Brahmins and householders of Magadha: “Kassapa of Uruvelā fares
the Brahma-faring under the great recluse.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.7" href="#Kd.1.22.7"></a>
Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the minds of these twelve
myriad Brahmins and householders of Magadha, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.49" href="#BD.4.49"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.37" href="#Vin.1.37"></a>
talked a progressive talk … stopping, the Way.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.8" href="#Kd.1.22.8"></a>
And as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take a dye, even so as
the twelve myriad Brahmins and householders of Magadha with Bimbisāra at their
head were (sitting) in those very seats, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them, that “Whatever is of the nature to
uprise, all that is of the nature to stop,” and one myriad declared themselves
to be lay-followers.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.9" href="#Kd.1.22.9"></a>
Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, plunged into <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having crossed over doubt, put away uncertainty, having attained without
another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to
the Lord: “Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man I had five ambitions. These
are now realised by me.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man it occurred to me: ‘Might I be anointed
into kingship.’ This was my first ambition, Lord. It has now been realised by
me.</li>
<li>And ‘Might the perfected one, the fully awakened one come into my realm.’ This,
Lord, was my second ambition. It has now been realised by me.<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.10" href="#Kd.1.22.10"></a></li>
<li>“And ‘That I might pay homage to this Lord.’ This, Lord, was my third ambition.
It has now been realised by me.</li>
<li>“And ‘May that Lord teach me <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.’ This, Lord, was my fourth ambition. It has now been realised by me.</li>
<li>“And ‘Might I understand that Lord’s <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.’ This, Lord, was my fifth ambition. It has now been realised by me.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man I had these five ambitions. They are
now realised by me.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.11" href="#Kd.1.22.11"></a>
“Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Even, Lord, as one might set upright what
has been upset … even so is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> explained in many a figure by the Lord. So I, Lord, go to the Lord as refuge
and to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to the Order of monks. Lord, may the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple gone
for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts. And, Lord, may the
Lord consent <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.38" href="#Vin.1.38"></a>
to a meal with me to-morrow together with the Order of monks.” The Lord
consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.12" href="#Kd.1.22.12"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.50" href="#BD.4.50"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having understood the Lord’s consent,
rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side
towards him. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having had sumptuous food,
solid and soft, prepared, at the end of that night had the time announced to
the Lord, saying: “Lord, it is time, the meal is ready.” Then the Lord, having
dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha together
with the large Order of monks, with all those same thousand monks who had
formerly been matted-hair ascetics.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.13" href="#Kd.1.22.13"></a>
Now at that time Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, having assumed the form of a Brahmin youth, walked in front of the Order of
monks with the Lord at its head, singing these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The tamed with the tamed, <br>
with the former matted-hair ascetics, <br>
the well freed with the well freed,<br>
The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament, <br>
entered Rājagaha.</p>
<p>“The freed with the freed, <br>
with the former matted-hair ascetics, <br>
the well freed with the well freed,<br>
The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament, <br>
entered Rājagaha.</p>
<p>“The crossed over with the crossed over, <br>
with the former matted-hair ascetics,<br>
the well freed with the well freed,<br>
The Lord, beautifully coloured like a golden ornament, <br>
entered Rājagaha.</p>
<p>“He of the ten states, <br>
of the ten powers, <br>
versed in the ten things, <br>
and furnished with the ten,<br>
He, the Lord, surrounded by ten hundred, <br>
entered Rājagaha.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.14" href="#Kd.1.22.14"></a>
People having seen Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, spoke thus: “Indeed this brahmin youth is lovely, indeed this brahmin youth
is good to look upon, indeed this brahmin youth is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.51" href="#BD.4.51"></a>
charming. Whose, now, is this brahmin youth?” When they had spoken thus, Sakka,
lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, addressed these people with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“He who is steadfast, tamed in every way, <br>
awakened, peerless among men,<br>
Perfected, well-farer, <br>
I am his attendant in the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.15" href="#Kd.1.22.15"></a>
Then the Lord approached the dwelling of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha;
having approached he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of
monks. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, with his own hand having offered,
having satisfied the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head with
sumptuous food, solid and soft, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his
hand from the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.39" href="#Vin.1.39"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.16" href="#Kd.1.22.16"></a>
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance it occurred to King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha: “Now, where could the Lord stay that would be neither too
far from a village nor too near, suitable for coming and going, accessible for
people whenever they want, not crowded by day, having little noise at night,
little sound, without folk’s breath, haunts of privacy, suitable for
seclusion?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.17" href="#Kd.1.22.17"></a>
Then it occurred to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: “Now, this Bamboo Grove
of ours, a pleasure park, is neither too far from a village … suitable for
seclusion. Suppose I were to give the Bamboo Grove, a pleasure park, to the
Order of the monks with the awakened one at its head?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.22.18" href="#Kd.1.22.18"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having taken a ceremonial vessel made of
gold, dedicated it to the Lord, saying: “May I, Lord, give this Bamboo Grove, a
pleasure park, to the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head?” The
Lord accepted the park. Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused,
delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having risen
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.52" href="#BD.4.52"></a>
from his seat, departed. Then the Lord, on this occasion having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, I allow a park.”</p>
<h2>On the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.23"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.1" href="#Kd.1.23.1"></a>
At that time the wanderer Sañjaya was residing in Rājagaha together with a
great company of wanderers, with two hundred and fifty wanderers. Now at that
time Sāriputta and Moggallāna fared the Brahma-faring under the wanderer
Sañjaya, and an agreement came to be formed by these: “Whoever attains the
deathless first, let him announce it.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.2" href="#Kd.1.23.2"></a>
Then the venerable Assaji,having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and
robe, entered Rājagaha for almsfood. He was pleasing whether he was approaching
or departing, whether he was looking in front or looking behind, whether he was
drawing in or stretching out (his arm), his eyes were cast down, he was
possessed of pleasant behaviour. The wanderer Sāriputta saw the venerable
Assaji walking for almsfood in Rājagaha—pleasing whether he was approaching …
possessed of pleasant behaviour—and seeing him, it occurred to him: “This is
one of those monks who are indeed perfected ones in the world or who have
entered on the way to perfection. What <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.40" href="#Vin.1.40"></a>
now if I, having approached this monk, should ask him: ‘On account of whom are
you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> do you profess’?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.3" href="#Kd.1.23.3"></a>
Then it occurred to the wanderer Sāriputta: “But it is not the right time to
question this monk, he has gone in among the houses, he is walking for
almsfood. What now if I should follow close after this monk who has learnt a
way for those who need it?” Then the venerable Assaji, having walked <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.53" href="#BD.4.53"></a>
for almsfood in Rājagaha, taking his almsbowl, returned. Then the wanderer
Sāriputta approached the venerable Assaji; having approached, he exchanged
greetings with the venerable Assaji; having exchanged courteous and friendly
greetings, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a
respectful distance, the wanderer Sāriputta spoke thus to the venerable Assaji:
“Your reverence, your faculties are quite pure, your complexion very bright,
very clear. On account of whom, your reverence, have you gone forth, or who is
your teacher, or whose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> do you profess?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.4" href="#Kd.1.23.4"></a>
“There is, friend, a great recluse, a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from a
Sakyan family. I have gone forth on account of this Lord and this Lord is my
teacher and I profess this Lord’s <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p>“But what is the doctrine of your reverence’s teacher, what does he point out?”</p>
<p>“Now, I, friend, am new, not long gone forth, fresh to this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline. I am not able to teach you <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in full, but I can tell you its purport briefly.”</p>
<p>Then the wanderer Sāriputta spoke thus to the venerable Assaji: “So be it, your
reverence, tell me little or tell me much, (but) in any case explain to me its
purport; I want just its purport. Why should you make a great elaboration?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.5" href="#Kd.1.23.5"></a>
Then the venerable Assaji uttered this terse expression of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to the wanderer Sāriputta:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.54" href="#BD.4.54"></a>
“Those things which proceed from a cause, <br>
of these the Truth-finder has told
the cause,<br>
And that which is their stopping—<br>
the great recluse has such a doctrine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the wanderer Sāriputta had heard this terse expression of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, there arose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, that “Whatever is of the nature to uprise all
that is of the nature to stop.” He said: “If this is indeed <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, you have penetrated as far as the sorrowless path, unseen, neglected for many
myriads of ӕons.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.6" href="#Kd.1.23.6"></a>
Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the wanderer Moggallāna. Then the
wanderer Moggallāna saw the wanderer Sāriputta coming in the distance, and
seeing <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.41" href="#Vin.1.41"></a>
the wanderer Sāriputta, he spoke thus: “Friend, your faculties are quite pure,
your complexion very bright, very clear. Can it be that you, friend, have
attained the deathless?”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend, I have attained the deathless.”</p>
<p>“But how did you, friend, attain the deathless?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.23.7" href="#Kd.1.23.7"></a>
“Now, I, friend, saw the venerable Assaji walking for almsfood in

<p>When the wanderer Moggallāna had heard this terse expression of

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.55" href="#BD.4.55"></a>
Then the wanderer Moggallāna spoke thus to the wanderer Sāriputta: “Let us go,
friend, to the Lord, (for) this Lord is the teacher for us.”</p>
<p>“Friend, these two hundred and fifty wanderers are staying here because of us,
looking to us; do let us consult them so that they may do what they think
(right).” Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached these wanderers; having
approached, they spoke thus to these wanderers:</p>
<p>“We are going, friends, to the Lord, (for) this Lord is the teacher for us.”</p>
<p>“We, venerable ones, are staying here because of you, looking to you. If the
venerable ones will fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse all of us
will fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.24.2" href="#Kd.1.24.2"></a>
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the wanderer Sañjaya; having
approached they spoke thus to the wanderer Sañjaya: “Sir, we are going to the
Lord, (for) this Lord is the teacher for us.”</p>
<p>“No, friends, do not go; we three will one and all look after this group.” And
a second time … And a third time … “… will look after this group.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.24.3" href="#Kd.1.24.3"></a>
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna, taking those two hundred and fifty wanderers,
approached the Bamboo Grove; but on that self-same spot hot blood issued from
the mouth of Sañjaya the wanderer. The Lord saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming
in the distance; seeing them, he addressed the monks saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, these two friends, Kolita and Upatissa, are coming. This pair of
disciples will be my chief, my eminent pair.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>When, in the deep sphere of knowledge,<br>
they had attained the matchless freedom <br>

Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Lord;
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.43" href="#Vin.1.43"></a>
having approached, having inclined their heads to the Lord’s feet, they spoke
thus to the Lord: “Lord, may we receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence,
may we receive ordination?”</p>
<p>“Come, monks,” the Lord said, “well taught is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” So this was these
venerable ones’ ordination.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.24.5" href="#Kd.1.24.5"></a>
Now at that time very distinguished young men belonging to respectable families
of Magadha were faring the Brahma-faring under the Lord. People looked down
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “The recluse Gotama gets along by
making (us) childless, the recluse Gotama gets along by making (us) widows, the
recluse Gotama gets along by breaking up families. A thousand matted hair
ascetics have now been allowed to go forth by him, and these two hundred and
fifty wanderers of Sañjaya have been allowed to go forth, and these very
distinguished young men belonging to respectable families of Magadha are faring
the Brahma-faring under the recluse Gotama.” Moreover, having seen the monks,
they reproved them in this verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“The great recluse has come <br>

Now at that time monks, being without preceptors, not being exhorted, not being
instructed, walked for almsfood wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not
befittingly attired. While people were eating, they held their almsbowls close

the solid food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the
savoury food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.4" href="#Kd.1.25.4"></a>
Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion,
in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the
monks, saying: “Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks walk for almsfood
wrongly dressed … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.45" href="#Vin.1.45"></a>
… and remain in the refectory making a great noise, a loud noise?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.5" href="#Kd.1.25.5"></a>
The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not fitting, monks, in these foolish men, it is not becoming, it is not
proper, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done.
How, monks, can these foolish men walk for almsfood … and remain in the
refectory making a loud noise, a great noise? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of) those who
are pleased, but it is, monks, for displeasing those who are not (yet) pleased
as well as those who are pleased, and for causing wavering in some.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.6" href="#Kd.1.25.6"></a>
Then the Lord, having rebuked these monks, having in many a figure spoken in
dispraise of difficulty in supporting and maintaining oneself, of great
desires, of lack of contentment, of clinging (to the obstructions), of
indolence; having in many a figure spoken in praise of ease in supporting and
maintaining oneself, of desiring little, of contentment, of expunging (evil),
of punctiliousness, of graciousness, of decreasing (the obstructions), of
putting forth energy, having given reasoned talk on what is fitting, on what is
becoming, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, I allow a preceptor. The preceptor, monks, should arouse in the one who
shares his cell the attitude of a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.59" href="#BD.4.59"></a>
son; the one who shares his cell should arouse in the preceptor the attitude of
a father. Thus these, living with reverence, with deference, with courtesy
towards one another, will come to growth, to increase, to maturity in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.7" href="#Kd.1.25.7"></a>
“And thus, monks, should a preceptor be chosen: having arranged the upper robe
over one shoulder, having honoured his feet, having sat down on the haunches,
having saluted with joined palms, he should speak to him thus: ‘Honoured sir,
be my preceptor; honoured sir, be my preceptor; honoured sir, be my preceptor.’
If he says: ‘Very well’ or ‘Certainly’ or ‘All right’ or ‘It is proper’ or
‘Manage it amiably’, and makes this understood by gesture, makes this
understood by speech, makes this understood by gesture and by speech, the
preceptor has been chosen; if he does not make this understood by gesture, if
he does not make this understood by speech, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.46" href="#Vin.1.46"></a>
if he does not make this understood by gesture and by speech, the preceptor has
not been chosen.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.8" href="#Kd.1.25.8"></a>
“The one who shares a cell, monks, should conduct himself properly towards the
preceptor. This is the proper conduct in this respect: having got up early,
having taken off his sandals, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
he should give tooth-wood, he should give water for rinsing the mouth, he
should make ready a seat. If there is conjey, having washed a bowl, the conjey
should be placed near (the preceptor). When he has drunk the conjey, having
given him water, having received the bowl, having lowered it, having washed it
properly without rubbing it, it should be put away. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.60" href="#BD.4.60"></a>
When the preceptor has got up, the seat should be removed. If that place is
soiled, that place should be swept.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.9" href="#Kd.1.25.9"></a>
“If the preceptor wishes to enter a village, his inner clothing should be given
(to him), the inner clothing (that he is wearing) should be received (from him)
in return, the girdle should be given (to him); having folded them (into two or
four folds), the outer robes are to be given (to him); having washed it, a bowl
with water is to be given (to him). If the preceptor desires an attendant, (the
latter) having put on his inner robe all round so as to cover the three
circles, having bound on the girdle, having folded them and having dressed in
the outer robes, having fastened the ties, having washed, having taken a bowl,
should be the preceptor’s attendant. He should not walk too far away (from
him), he should not walk too close. He should receive the bowl and its
contents.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.10" href="#Kd.1.25.10"></a>
“He should not interrupt the preceptor when he is speaking. (But) if the
preceptor is bordering on an offence, then speaking himself, he should warn
him. When he is returning, he should make a seat ready, having come back first;
he should set out water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand; <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.61" href="#BD.4.61"></a>
having gone to meet him, he should receive his bowl and robe, he should give
back the inner clothing (given) in return, he should receive his inner
clothing. If a robe is damp with perspiration, he should dry it for a short
time in the sun’s warmth, but a robe should not be laid aside in the warmth. He
should fold up the robe. When folding up the robe, having made the corners turn
back four finger-breadths, he should fold up the robe thinking: ‘Mind there is
no crease in the middle.’ The girdle should be placed in a fold (of the robe).
If there comes to be almsfood and the preceptor wishes to eat, having given him
water, almsfood should be placed near (him).</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.11" href="#Kd.1.25.11"></a>
“He should offer the preceptor drinking-water. When he has eaten, having given
him water, having received the bowl, having lowered it, having washed it
properly without rubbing it, having emptied out the water, he should dry it for
a short time in the sun’s warmth, but a bowl should not be laid aside in the
warmth. He should lay aside the bowl and robes. When laying aside the bowl,
having taken the bowl in one hand, having felt with the other hand under the
couch or <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.47" href="#Vin.1.47"></a>
under the chair, the bowl should be laid aside, but the bowl should not be laid
aside on the bare ground. When laying aside a robe, having taken the robe in
one hand, having stroked the other hand along the bamboo for robes or the cord
for robes, having got the edges away from him and the fold towards him, the
robe should be laid aside. When the preceptor has got up, the seat should be
removed, the water for washing the feet, the foot-stool, the foot-stand should
be put away. If that place comes to be soiled, that place should be swept.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.12" href="#Kd.1.25.12"></a>
“If the preceptor wishes to bathe, he should prepare a bath. If he wants a cold
(bath), he should prepare a cold one; if he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.62" href="#BD.4.62"></a>
wants a hot (bath), he should prepare a hot one. If the preceptor wishes to
enter a bathroom, he should knead chunam should moisten clay; taking a chair
for the bathroom, having gone close behind the preceptor, having given him the
chair for the bathroom, having received his robe, he should lay it to one side.
He should give him the chunam, he should give him the clay. If he is able to do
so, he should enter the bathroom. When he is entering the bathroom, having
smeared his face with clay, having covered himself front and back, he should
enter the bathroom.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.25.13" href="#Kd.1.25.13"></a>
“He should not sit down so as to encroach upon (the space intended for) monks
who are elders. He should not keep newly ordained monks from a seat. He should
make preparation for the preceptor in the bathroom. When he is leaving the
bathroom, taking the chair for the bathroom, having covered himself front and
back, he should leave the bath-room. He should also make preparation for the
preceptor in the water. When he is bathing, having come out (of the water)
first, having dried his own body, having put on his inner robe, he should wipe
off the water from the preceptor’s limbs, he should give him his inner
clothing, he should give him his outer cloak; taking the chair for the
bathroom, having come back first, he should make ready a seat, he should put
out water for washing the feet, a footstool, a footstand. He should offer the
preceptor drinking-water.</p>

soiled, it should be cleaned if he is able (to do so). When he is cleaning the
dwelling-place, having first taken out the bowl and robes, he should lay them
to one side. Having taken out the piece of cloth to sit upon and the sheet, he
should lay them to one side. Having taken out the mattress and the
squatting-mat, he should lay them to one side.</p>

spittoon, he should lay it to one side. Having taken out the reclining-board,he
should lay it to one side. Having taken out the ground-covering, having
observed how it was laid down, he should lay it to one side. If there come to
be cobwebs in the dwelling-place, he should first remove them from the (floor-)
covering; he should wipe the corners of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.64" href="#BD.4.64"></a>
the window-holes. If a wall that was coloured red becomes stained, he should
wipe it, having moistened a rag, having wrung it out. If ground that was
blacked becomes stained he should wipe it, having moistened a rag, having wrung
it out. If the ground did not come to be treated, he should sweep it, having
sprinkled it all over with water, thinking: ‘Take care lest the dwelling-place
is sullied with dust.’ Having looked for (any) rubbish, he should remove it to
one side.</p>

Now at that time a certain brahmin, having approached (some) monks, asked for
the going forth. The monks did not want to let him go forth, and because he
could not obtain the going forth among the monks, he became lean, wretched, of
a bad colour, very yellow, his veins standing out all over his body. The Lord
saw this brahmin, lean … all over his body, and seeing him, he addressed the
monks, saying: “How is it, monks, that this brahmin is lean … all over his
body?”</p>
<p>“Lord, this brahmin asked the monks for the going forth. The monks did not want
to let him go forth, and because he could not obtain the going forth among the

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.72" href="#BD.4.72"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Now, monks, who remembers a service
done by this brahmin?” When he had spoken thus the venerable Sāriputta spoke
thus to the Lord: “I, Lord, remember a service done by this brahmin.”</p>
<p>“Now, what help (given) by this brahmin, Sāriputta, do you remember?”</p>
<p>“Lord, as I was walking for almsfood here in Rājagaha this brahmin had
spoon-alms bestowed upon me. This, Lord, is the service done by this brahmin <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.56" href="#Vin.1.56"></a>
which I remember.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.28.3" href="#Kd.1.28.3"></a>
“Good, Sāriputta, it is good. Indeed those who are truly men, Sāriputta, are
thankful and grateful. Because of this do you, Sāriputta, let this brahmin go
forth (and) ordain him.”</p>
<p>“How, lord, do I let this brahmin go forth, how do I ordain him?”</p>
<p>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“From this day forth, monks, I abolish that ordination by going to the three
refuges which I allowed. I allow you, monks, to ordain by a (formal) act
consisting of a motion and a resolution put three times.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.28.4" href="#Kd.1.28.4"></a>
“And thus, monks, should one ordain: The Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order hear me. This (person) so and so wishes for
ordination from the venerable so and so. If it seems right to the Order, the
Order may ordain so and so, through the preceptor so and so. This is the

“<span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order hear me. This person so and so … may ordain so

the ordination of so and so through the preceptor so and so is pleasing to the

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.29.1" href="#Kd.1.29.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk immediately after he was ordained indulged in
bad habits. Monks spoke thus: “Do not, your reverence, do that, it is not
allowed.” He spoke thus: “But indeed, I did not ask the venerable ones saying,
‘Ordain me’. Why did you ordain me without being asked (to do so)?” They told
this matter to the Lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.57" href="#Vin.1.57"></a>
He said:
<span class="rule">“Monks, you should not ordain without being asked (to do so). Whoever should

“And thus, monks, should one ask (for it): That one who wishes for ordination,
having approached the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
having honoured the monks’ feet, having sat down on his haunches, having
saluted with joined palms, should speak thus to it: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, I ask the Order for ordination; honoured sirs, may the Order

Now at that time in Rājagaha a succession of meals of sumptuous foods came to
be arranged. Then it occurred to a certain brahmin: “Now, these recluses, sons
of the Sakyans, are pleasant in character, pleasant in conduct; having eaten
good meals they lie down on beds sheltered from the wind. What now if I should
go forth among these recluses, sons of the Sakyans?” Then that brahmin, having
approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks allowed him to go
forth (and) they ordained him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.30.2" href="#Kd.1.30.2"></a>
The succession of meals dwindled away after he had gone forth. Monks spoke
thus: “Come along now, your reverence, we will walk for almsfood.” He spoke
thus: “Your reverences, I did not go forth for this—that I should walk for
almsfood. If you will give to me, I will eat, but if you will not give to me, I
will leave the Order.”</p>
<p>“But, did you, your reverence, go forth for your belly’s sake?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.58" href="#Vin.1.58"></a>
</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.30.3" href="#Kd.1.30.3"></a>
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying: “How can this monk go forth in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline which are well taught for his belly’s sake?” These monks told
this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, went forth for your belly’s sake?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, go forth in this
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline which are well taught for your belly’s sake? It is not foolish
man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.75" href="#BD.4.75"></a>
nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased.” Having rebuked him,
having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.30.4" href="#Kd.1.30.4"></a>
“I allow you, monks, when you are ordaining, to explain four resources: that
going forth is on account of meals of scraps; in this respect effort is to be
made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: a meal for an Order, a
meal for a special person, an invitation, ticket-food, (food given) on a day of
the waxing or waning of the moon, on an Observance day, or the day after an
Observance day. That going forth is on account of rag-robes; in this respect
effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: (robes
made of) linen, cotton, silk, wool, coarse hemp, canvas. That going forth is on
account of a lodging at the root of a tree; in this respect effort is to be
made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: a dwelling-place, a
curved house, a long house, a mansion, a cave. That going forth is on account
of ammonia as a medicine; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life.

Now at that time a certain brahmin youth, having approached
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.76" href="#BD.4.76"></a>
(some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks explained the resources to
him beforehand. He spoke thus: “If honoured sirs, you had explained the
resources to me after I had gone forth, I should have been satisfied, but now,
honoured sirs, I will not go forth; the resources are disgusting and loathsome
to me.” The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“

Now at that time monks ordained through a group of two and a group of three
(monks). They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, you should not ordain through a group of less than ten (monks). Whoever

Now at that time monks of one year’s standing and of two years’ standing
(severally) ordained the one who shared his cell. And when he was of one year’s
standing, the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son, ordained the one who shared
his cell. When he was of two years’ standing, having kept the rains-residence,
taking the one who shared his cell and who was of one year’s standing, he
approached the Lord. Having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at
a respectful distance. Now, it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to
exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.31.4" href="#Kd.1.31.4"></a>
Then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son: “I hope,
monk, that things go well with you, I hope you are keeping going, I hope you
came here with but little fatigue on the journey.”</p>
<p>“Things do go well with me, Lord, I am keeping going, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.77" href="#BD.4.77"></a>
Lord, I came, Lord, with but little fatigue on the journey.”</p>
<p>Now, Truthfinders (sometimes) ask knowing, and knowing (sometimes) do not ask;
they ask, knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the
right time (when not to ask). Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal,
not about what does not belong to the goal. There is bridge-breaking, for
Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal. Awakened ones, Lords,
question monks concerning two matters: “Shall we teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?” or “Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.31.5" href="#Kd.1.31.5"></a>
Then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son: “Of how many
years’ standing are you, monk?”</p>
<p>“I, Lord, am of two years’ standing.”</p>
<p>“And of how many years’ standing is this monk?”</p>
<p>“He is of one year’s standing, Lord.”</p>
<p>“Who is this monk as regards you?”</p>
<p>“He is the one who shares my cell, Lord.”</p>
<p>The awakened one, the Lord rebuked (him), saying:</p>
<p>“It is not fitting, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is
unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How can you,
foolish man, when you should be exhorted and instructed by others, think to
exhort and instruct another (monk)? Too quickly have you, foolish man, turned
to abundance, that is to say to acquiring a group. It is not, foolish man, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of)
those who are pleased.” Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>

Now at that time the one who had formerly been a member of another sect when he
was being spoken to by his preceptor regarding a rule, having refuted the
preceptor, went over to the fold of that same sect (as before), but having come
back again, he asked the monks for ordination. The monks told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Monks, he who was formerly a member of another sect … having refuted the
preceptor and going over to the fold of that same sect (as before), on coming
back should not be ordained. But, monks, whoever else was formerly a member of

Thus, monks, does a former member of another sect become one who fails. And
again, monks, a former member of another sect comes to be one whose resort (for

“And again, monks, a former member of another sect in regard to those various

too, monks, does a former member of another sect become one who fails. And

<h2>The story of five diseases</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.39"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.1" href="#Kd.1.39.1"></a>
Now at that time five diseases were prevalent among the people of Magadha:
leprosy, boils, eczema, consumption, epilepsy. People, afflicted with the five
diseases, having approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca, spoke thus: “It were good,
teacher, if you would attend us.”</p>
<p>“But I, masters, am very busy, there is much to be done, and King <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.72" href="#Vin.1.72"></a>
Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha is to be looked after by me, also the women’s
quarters and the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head. I am not
able to attend you.”</p>
<p>“All this property shall become yours, teacher, and we will be your slaves. It
were good, teacher, if you would attend us.”</p>
<p>“But I, masters, am very busy … I am not able to attend you.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.2" href="#Kd.1.39.2"></a>
Then it occurred to these people: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are of
pleasant character, of pleasant conduct; having eaten good meals, they lie
down, on beds sheltered <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.90" href="#BD.4.90"></a>
from the wind. Suppose we were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the
Sakyans? In that case monks would look after us and moreover Jīvaka
Komārabhacca would attend us.” Then these people, having approached (some)
monks, asked for the going forth. The monks let them go forth, they ordained
them. These monks looked after them and moreover Jīvaka Komārabhacca attended
them.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.3" href="#Kd.1.39.3"></a>
Now at that time monks, looking after many ill monks, lived intent on asking,
intent on hinting, saying: “Give food for the sick, give food for those who
look after the sick, give medicines for the sick.” And Jīvaka Komārabhacca,
attending many ill monks, omitted some of his duties towards the king.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.4" href="#Kd.1.39.4"></a>
A certain man, afflicted with the five diseases, having approached Jīvaka
Komārabhacca, spoke thus: “It were good, teacher, if you would attend me.”</p>
<p>“But I, master, am very busy … I am not able to attend you.”</p>
<p>“All this property shall be yours, teacher, and I will be your slave. It were
good, teacher, if you would attend me.”</p>
<p>“But I, master, am very busy … I am not able to attend you.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.5" href="#Kd.1.39.5"></a>
Then it occurred to that man: “Now these recluses, sons of the Sakyans are of
pleasant character … Suppose I were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the
Sakyans? In that case monks would look after me and moreover Jīvaka
Komārabhacca would attend me; and when I am well I will leave the Order.”</p>
<p>Then that man, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. These
monks let him go forth, they ordained him. These monks looked after him and
moreover Jīvaka Komārabhacca attended him. When he was well he left the Order.
Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.73" href="#Vin.1.73"></a>
that man who had left the Order; seeing him, he spoke thus to that man: “Had
not you, master, gone forth among the monks?”</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher.”</p>
<p>“Then why have you, master, acted in this way?” Then this man told this matter
to Jīvaka Komārabhacca.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.6" href="#Kd.1.39.6"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.91" href="#BD.4.91"></a>
Jīvaka Komārabhacca looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How
can these honoured sirs let one afflicted with the five diseases go forth?”
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: “It were well,
Lord, if the masters did not let one afflicted with (any one of) the five
diseases go forth.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.39.7" href="#Kd.1.39.7"></a>
The Lord then gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Jīvaka Komārabhacca with
talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right
side towards him. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, one afflicted with (any one of) the five diseases should not be let go
forth. Whoever should let (one such) go forth, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.40"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.40.1" href="#Kd.1.40.1"></a>
Now at that time there came to be a disturbance on the borderlands of King
Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded
the generals, the chief ministers, saying: “Go, good sirs, search the
borderlands.”</p>
<p>“Very well, sire,” the generals, the chief ministers answered King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.40.2" href="#Kd.1.40.2"></a>
Then it occurred to (some) very distinguished warriors: “Because we delight in
battle, we do evil and we engender much demerit. Now by what means could we
refrain from evil and do what is good?” Then it occurred to these warriors:
“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans are <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-farers, even-farers, Brahma-farers, they are truth-speakers, of moral habit,
of good character. Now, if we were to go forth among these recluses, sons of
the Sakyans, thus might we refrain from evil and do what is good.” Then these
warriors, having <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.92" href="#BD.4.92"></a>
approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks let them go
forth, they ordained them.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.40.3" href="#Kd.1.40.3"></a>
The generals, the chief ministers, asked those in the King’s service: “How
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.74" href="#Vin.1.74"></a>
is it, good sirs, that the warriors, so and so and so and so, are not to be
seen?”</p>
<p>“Sirs, the warriors, so and so and so and so, have gone forth among the monks.”
The generals, the chief ministers … spread it about, saying: “How can these
recluses, sons of the Sakyans, let one who is in the king’s service go forth?”
The generals, the chief ministers told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of
Magadha. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha asked the chief ministers of
justice:</p>
<p>“Good sirs, what does he who lets one go forth who is in a king’s service
engender (for himself)?”</p>
<p>“Sire, a preceptor’s head should be cut off, the tongue should be torn from the
announcer of a proclamation, half the ribs of a (member of a) group should be
broken.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.40.4" href="#Kd.1.40.4"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Lord; having approached,
having greeted the lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was
sitting down at a respectful distance, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke
thus to the Lord: “There are, Lord, kings who are of no faith, not believing;
these might harm monks even for a trifling matter. It were well, Lord, if the
masters did not let one in a king’s service go forth.” Then the Lord gladdened
… delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, gladdened … delighted by the Lord with
talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right
side towards him. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, one in a king’s service should not be let go forth. Whoever should let
(one such) go forth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

Now at that time a thief (wearing) a garland of fingers came to have gone forth
among the monks. People, having seen (him), were perturbed, then alarmed, then
they ran away, then they went by a different route, then they turned in another
direction, then they closed the door. People … spread it about, saying: “How
can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans let a thief wearing an emblem go forth?”
Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this
matter to the Lord. The Lord addressed the monks saying:</p>

Now at that time it
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.75" href="#Vin.1.75"></a>
was decreed by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: “There is nothing to do
against those who go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans. Well
preached is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, let them fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill.” Now at that
time a certain man, having committed a theft, was imprisoned in a jail; he,
having broken out of jail, having run away, went forth among the monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.42.2" href="#Kd.1.42.2"></a>
People having seen (him) spoke thus: “This is the very thief who has broken out
of jail. Come along, let us bring him (back).” Some spoke thus: “Do not,
masters, speak thus, for it is decreed by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:
‘There is nothing to do against those … utter end of ill.’” People … spread it

<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans are safe and secure; <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.94" href="#BD.4.94"></a>
there is nothing to do against them. But how can they let a thief go forth who

Now at that time a certain man, having committed a theft, having run away, went
forth among the monks. And in the royal palace, this was written: “Wherever he
may be seen, there he should be killed.” People, having seen (him), spoke thus:
“This is the very thief who was written about. Come along, let us kill him.”
Some spoke thus: “Do not, masters, speak thus … utter end of ill.’” People …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“These recluses, sons of the Sakyans are safe and secure; there is nothing to
do against them. But how can they let a thief go forth who has been written

Now at that time a certain bald-headed metal-smith, having quarrelled with his
parents, having gone to a monastery, went forth among the monks. Then the
parents of that bald-headed metal-smith, searching for that bald-headed
metal-smith, having gone to the monastery, asked the monks, saying: “Honoured
sirs, have you seen a youth like that?” The monks, not knowing (him), merely
said: “We do not know (him)”; not seeing (him), merely said: “We do not see
(him).”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.48.2" href="#Kd.1.48.2"></a>

<h2>The story of the boy Upāli</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.49"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.49.1" href="#Kd.1.49.1"></a>
Now at that time in Rājagaha a group of seventeen boys were friends; of these
the youth Upāli was the chief. Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: “By what
means could Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want?” Then it
occurred to Upāli’s parents: “If Upāli should learn writing, so would Upāli,
after our demise, live at ease and not be in want.” Then it occurred to Upāli’s
parents: “But if Upāli <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.97" href="#BD.4.97"></a>
learns writing his fingers will become painful. If Upāli were to learn
calculation, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in
want.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.49.2" href="#Kd.1.49.2"></a>
Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: “But if Upāli learns calculation, his
breast will become painful. If Upāli were to learn money-changing, so would
Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want.” Then it occurred to
Upāli’s parents: “But if Upāli learns money-changing his eyes will become
painful. Now there are these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, pleasant in habit,
pleasant in conduct; having eaten good meals, they lie down on beds sheltered
from the wind. Now if Upāli were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.49.3" href="#Kd.1.49.3"></a>
The boy Upāli heard this conversation of his parents. Then the boy Upāli
approached those boys; having approached, he spoke thus to these boys: “Come,
masters, we will go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans.”</p>
<p>“If you, master, will go forth, we likewise will also go forth.” Then these
boys, having (each) approached his parents, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Consent that I may go forth from home into homelessness.” Then <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.78" href="#Vin.1.78"></a>
the parents of those boys consented, thinking: “All these boys want the same
thing, they are bent on what is good.” These, having approached monks, asked
for the going forth. These monks let them go forth, they ordained them.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.49.4" href="#Kd.1.49.4"></a>
Getting up in the night towards dawn, these cried out: “Give conjey, give rice,
give solid food.”</p>
<p>The monks spoke thus: “Wait, your reverences, until it turns light. Should
there be conjey you shall drink it; should there be rice you shall partake of
it; should there be solid food you shall eat it. But should there not be conjey
or rice or solid food, then, having walked for alms, you shall eat.”</p>
<p>But these monks, being spoken to thus by the monks, cried out just the same:
“Give conjey, give rice, give solid food,” and they soiled and wetted the
bedding.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.49.5" href="#Kd.1.49.5"></a>
Then the Lord, getting up in the night towards dawn, hearing this noise of
boys, addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: “Why ever, Ānanda, is there this
noise of boys?” Then the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.98" href="#BD.4.98"></a>
venerable Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true as is said, monks, that monks knowingly ordain an individual who is
under twenty years of age?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men knowingly ordain an individual who is under
twenty years of age?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.49.6" href="#Kd.1.49.6"></a>
Monks, an individual under twenty years of age is not able to endure cold,
heat, hunger, thirst, the sting of gadflies or mosquitoes, wind and sun,
creeping things, abusive, hurtful language; he is not the kind (of person) who
endures bodily feelings which, arising, are painful, acute, sharp, shooting,
disagreeable, miserable, deadly. But, monks, an individual of twenty years of
age is able to endure cold, heat … miserable, deadly. Monks, this is not for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing the number of
those who are pleased.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, an individual who is under twenty years of age should not knowingly be
ordained. Whoever should (so) ordain (one such) should be dealt with according
to the rule.</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.50"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.50.1" href="#Kd.1.50.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain family came to pass away as a result of malaria.
(Only) the father and little son belonging to it survived. These, having gone
forth among the monks, walked even for almsfood together. Then that boy, when
almsfood was given to his father, having run up to him, spoke thus: “Give to me
too, father, give to me too, father.” People <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.79" href="#Vin.1.79"></a>
… spread it about, saying: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are not
chaste. This boy was born of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.99" href="#BD.4.99"></a>
a nun.” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told
this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, a boy of less than fifteen years of age should not be let go forth.
Whoever should let (one such) go forth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.51"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.51.1" href="#Kd.1.51.1"></a>
Now at that time the family, faithful, believing, who supported the venerable
Ānanda, passed away as a result of malaria, but two boys survived. These,
having seen monks, ran up to them according to their former allowable custom,
(but) the monks sent them away. These cried on being sent away by the monks.
Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda: “It is laid down by the Lord that a
boy of less than fifteen years of age should not be allowed to go forth, and
these boys are less than fifteen years of age. Now by what means might these
boys not be lost?” Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“But, Ānanda, are these boys able to scare crows?”</p>
<p>“They are able (to do so), Lord.” Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this
connection having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to let a youth of less than fifteen years of age and who is
a scarer of crows go forth.</span>”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.52"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.52.1" href="#Kd.1.52.1"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, had two
novices, Kaṇḍaka and Mahaka. These committed sodomy with one another. Monks
looked down <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.100" href="#BD.4.100"></a>
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these novices indulge in a
bad habit such as this?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, two novices should not attend one (monk). Whoever should make two
novices attend him, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<h2>The story of when it was crowded</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.53"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.53.1" href="#Kd.1.53.1"></a>
Now at that time the Lord spent the rains just there, in Rājagaha, the cold
weather there, the hot weather there. People … spread it about, saying: “The
district is crowded up, confused with recluses, sons of the Sakyans; because of
them the district is not to be seen.” Monks, heard these people who … spread it
about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.53.2" href="#Kd.1.53.2"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: “Go, Ānanda, and taking a
key, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.80" href="#Vin.1.80"></a>
announce to the monks in every cell: “Your reverences, the Lord wishes to set
out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri. Whatever venerable one needs (to do so), let him
come.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord,” and the venerable Ānanda, having answered the Lord in assent,
taking the key, announced to the monks in every cell: “Your reverences, the
Lord wishes to set out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri. Whatever venerable one needs
(to do so), let him come.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.53.3" href="#Kd.1.53.3"></a>
Monks spoke thus: “Reverend Ānanda, it is laid down by the Lord (that one is)
to live ten years in dependence, and when one is of ten years’ standing (he is)
to give guidance. If we go there then guidance must be chosen (there), but the
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.101" href="#BD.4.101"></a>
stop (there) may be short; then we must come back again and guidance must be
chosen again. If our teachers and preceptors are going, we too will go; but if
our teachers and preceptors are not going, then we will not go. Reverend
Ānanda, we shall (otherwise) look feather-brained.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.53.4" href="#Kd.1.53.4"></a>
Then the Lord set out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri with an Order of monks numbering
less than a group.</p>
<h2>On release from dependence</h2>
<p>Then the Lord, having stayed in Dakkhiṇāgiri for as long as he found suiting,
came back again to Rājagaha. Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda,
saying: “How is it, Ānanda, that the Truthfinder set out on tour for
Dakkhiṇāgiri with an Order of monks numbering less than a group?” Then the
venerable Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion,
in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<h2>The story of Rāhula</h2>
<p>Then the Lord, having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Kapilavatthu. Walking on tour in due course he arrived at
Kapilavatthu. The Lord stayed there among the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu in the
Banyan monastery. Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl
and robe, approached the dwelling of Suddhodana the Sakyan; having approached
he sat down on the appointed seat. Then the lady, Rāhula’s mother, spoke thus
to the boy Rāhula: “This, Rāhula, is your father, go and ask him for your
inheritance.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.54"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.54.2" href="#Kd.1.54.2"></a>
Then the boy Rāhula approached the Lord; having approached, he stood in front
of the Lord and said: “Pleasant is your shadow, recluse.” Then the Lord, rising
up from his seat, departed. Then the boy Rāhula, following close behind the
Lord, said: “Give me my inheritance, recluse, give me my inheritance, recluse.”
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Sāriputta, saying: “Well then, do you,
Sāriputta, let the boy Rāhula go forth.”</p>
<p>“How do I, Lord, let the boy Rāhula go forth?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.54.3" href="#Kd.1.54.3"></a>
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk,
addressed the monks, saying: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, the going forth for novices by the three goings for refuge. And
thus, monks, should you let one go forth: first, having made him have his hair
and beard cut off, having got (someone) to present him with yellow robes,
having made him arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, having made him
honour the monks’ feet, having made him sit down on his haunches, having made
him salute with joined palms, he should <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.104" href="#BD.4.104"></a>
be told: ‘Speak thus:

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.54.4" href="#Kd.1.54.4"></a>
Then the venerable Sāriputta let the boy Rāhula go forth. Then Suddhodana the
Sakyan approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat
down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance
Suddhodana the Sakyan spoke thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“I, Lord, ask the Lord for one boon.”</p>
<p>“But, Gotama, Truth-finders are beyond (granting) boons.”</p>
<p>“Lord, it is what is allowable, it is what is blameless.”</p>
<p>“Speak on, Gotama.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.54.5" href="#Kd.1.54.5"></a>
“Lord, when the Lord went forth there came to be not a little sorrow, likewise

Affection for a son, Lord, cuts into the skin, having cut into the skin it cuts
into the hide, having cut into the hide it cuts into the flesh … the ligaments

Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Suddhodana the Sakyan with
talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then Suddhodana the Sakyan gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right

given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, a child who has not his parents’ consent should not be let go forth.
Whoever should let (one such) go forth, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

Then the Lord, having stayed in Kapilavatthu for as long as he found suiting,
set out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour in due course he arrived at
Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there in Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the family who supported the
venerable Sāriputta sent a youth to the venerable Sāriputta, saying: “May the
elder let this youth go forth.” Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta: “A
rule of training laid down by the Lord says that two novices should not attend
one (monk), and this Rāhula is my novice. Now what line of conduct should be
followed by me?” He told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, two novices to attend one experienced, competent monk, or else
as many to attend (him) as he is able to exhort, to instruct.</span>”</p>

Then it occurred to the novices: “Now, how many rules for training are there
for us and in which we are to train?” They told this matter to the Lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“Monks, <span class="allowance">I allow ten rules for training for novices and novices to train in these: </span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.57"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.57.1" href="#Kd.1.57.1"></a>
Now at that time novices were not respectful, not deferential not courteous
towards the monks. Monks … spread it about saying: “How can these novices not
be respectful … towards the monks?” They told this matter to the Lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“Monks, <span class="allowance">I allow you to impose a punishment on a novice who is possessed of five
qualities:</span></p>

<li>“<span class="rule">If he tries for non-receiving (of gains) by monks.</span></li>

<p>“I allow you, monks, to impose a punishment on a novice who is possessed of
these five qualities.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.57.2" href="#Kd.1.57.2"></a>
Then it occurred to these monks: “Now, how should the punishment be imposed?”
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a prohibition.</span>” Now at that time monks made a prohibition for novices in respect of an
Order’s entire monastery. The novices, on being unable to enter the monastery,
went away, and left the Order, and went over to (other) sects. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, an Order’s entire monastery should not be made (the subject of) a
prohibition. Whoever should make (it such), there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>

or wherever he is entering.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.57.3" href="#Kd.1.57.3"></a>
Now at that time monks made a prohibition for novices in respect of nutriment
taken by the mouth. People, making a drink of conjey and also rice for an
Order, spoke thus to the novices: “Come, honoured sirs, drink the conjey, come,
honoured sirs, partake of the rice.” The novices spoke thus: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.107" href="#BD.4.107"></a>
“It is not possible, sirs, the monks have made (this the subject of) a
prohibition.” The people … spread it about, saying: “How can these revered sirs
make a prohibition for novices in respect of nutriment taken by the mouth?”
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, nutriment taken by the mouth is not to be made (the subject of) a

Now at that time the group of six monks,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.85" href="#Vin.1.85"></a>
without having asked preceptors (for permission), made a prohibition for
novices. Preceptors hunted about, saying: “Now, where are our novices? They are
not to be seen.” Monks spoke thus: “A prohibition was made, your reverences, by
the group of six monks.” The preceptors … spread it about, saying: “How can
this group of six monks, without asking us (for permission), make a prohibition
for our novices?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, a prohibition is not to be made without asking preceptors (for

Now at that time the group of six monks lured away the novices of monks who
were elders. The elders, getting their own tooth-wood and water for rinsing the
mouth, were incommoded. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, another’s assembly should not be lured away. Whoever should lure it

Now at that time Kaṇḍaka, a novice of the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, seduced the nun Kaṇḍakā. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.108" href="#BD.4.108"></a>
Monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this novice indulge in a bad habit
like this?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to expel a novice who is possessed of ten qualities:

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.61"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.61.1" href="#Kd.1.61.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain eunuch came to have gone forth among the monks.
Having approached a number of young monks, he spoke thus: “Come, venerable
ones, commit an offence with me.” The monks refused, saying: “Be off, eunuch,
depart, eunuch. What need have you?” Refused by the monks, having approached a
number of large, fat novices, he spoke thus: “Come, your reverences, commit an
offence with me.” The novices refused, saying: “Be off, eunuch, depart, eunuch.
What need have you?” Refused by the novices, having approached mahouts <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.86" href="#Vin.1.86"></a>
and grooms, he spoke thus: “Come, sirs, commit an offence with me.” The mahouts
and grooms committed an offence with him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.61.2" href="#Kd.1.61.2"></a>
These … spread it about, saying: “These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are
eunuchs, and those of them who are not eunuchs, they too commit offences with
eunuchs. Thus they are one and all unchaste.” Monks heard these mahouts and
grooms who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He
said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.109" href="#BD.4.109"></a>
“<span class="rule">Monks, if a eunuch is not ordained, he should not be ordained; if he is

<h2>The story of one in communion by theft</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.62"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.62.1" href="#Kd.1.62.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain descendant of an ancient family which had come down
in the world was delicately nurtured. Then it occurred to this descendant of
the ancient family which had come down in the world: “Now, I am delicately
nurtured, I am not able to acquire wealth not (already) acquired, nor to
increase the wealth (already) acquired. Now by what means could I live at ease
and not be in want?” Then it occurred to this descendant … in the world: “Now
these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are of pleasant conduct, of pleasant
character; having eaten good meals, they lie down to sleep on beds sheltered
from the wind. Suppose that I, having prepared a bowl and robe for myself,
having cut off my hair and beard, having clothed myself in yellow robes, having
gone to a monastery, should be in communion together with monks?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.62.2" href="#Kd.1.62.2"></a>
Then that descendant … in the world, having prepared a bowl and robe for
himself, having cut off his hair and beard, having clothed himself in yellow
robes, having gone to a monastery, greeted the monks. The monks spoke thus: “Of
how many years’ standing are you, your reverence?” “What does this mean, your
reverences: ‘how many years’ standing’?”</p>
<p>“But who, your reverence, is your preceptor?”</p>
<p>“What does this mean, your reverences: ‘preceptor’?”</p>
<p>The monks spoke thus to the venerable Upāli:</p>
<p>“Please, reverend Upāli, examine this one who has gone forth.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.62.3" href="#Kd.1.62.3"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.110" href="#BD.4.110"></a>
Then as that descendant … in the world was being examined by the venerable
Upāli, he told him this matter. The venerable Upāli told this matter to the
monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, if one who is in communion by theft is not ordained, he should not be
ordained; if he is ordained, he should be expelled. Monks, if one who has gone
over to (another) sect is not ordained, he should not be ordained; if he is

<h2>The story of an animal</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.63"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.63.1" href="#Kd.1.63.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain serpent was troubled about his birth as a serpent,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.87" href="#Vin.1.87"></a>
he was ashamed of it, loathed it. Then it occurred to that serpent: “Now, by
what means could I be freed quickly from birth as a serpent and get back human
status?” Then it occurred to that serpent: “These recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, are <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-farers, even-farers, Brahma-farers, they are truth-speakers, they are of moral
habit, of good conduct. Now if I were to go forth among the recluses, sons of
the Sakyans, so would I be freed quickly from birth as a serpent and could get
back human status.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.63.2" href="#Kd.1.63.2"></a>
Then that serpent, in the form of a brahmin youth, having approached the monks,
asked for the going forth. The monks let him go forth, they ordained him. Now
at that time that serpent, together with a certain monk, was living in a
dwelling-place on the boundary. Then that monk, getting up in the night towards
dawn, paced up and down in the open air. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.111" href="#BD.4.111"></a>
Then that serpent, confident that that monk had gone out, fell asleep. The
whole dwelling-place was full of the snake, his coils were protruding through
the windows.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.63.3" href="#Kd.1.63.3"></a>
Then that monk, thinking: “I will enter the dwelling-place,” opening the door,
saw the whole dwelling-place full of the snake, his coils protruding through
the windows. Terrified at seeing this, he uttered a cry of distress. Monks,
having run up, spoke thus to that monk: “Why did you, your reverence, utter a
cry of distress?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this whole dwelling-place is full of a snake, his coils are
protruding through the windows.” Then that serpent having awakened because of
this noise, sat down on his own seat. Monks spoke thus: “Who are you, friend?”</p>
<p>“I am a serpent, honoured sirs.”</p>
<p>“But why did you, friend, act in this way?” Then that serpent told this matter
to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.63.4" href="#Kd.1.63.4"></a>
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, spoke thus to this serpent: “Indeed, you serpents are not
liable to growth in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline. You, serpent, go away, observe the Observance day precisely on
the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth day of the half-month. Thus will you be
freed quickly from birth as a serpent and get back human status.”</p>
<p>Then that serpent, thinking: “It is said that I am not liable to growth in this
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline,” pained, afflicted, shedding tears, departed having uttered a
cry of distress.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.63.5" href="#Kd.1.63.5"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, there are these two cases of
manifestation of a serpent’s true nature: when he indulges in sexual
intercourse with a female of his own species, and when he falls asleep in
confidence. Monks, these are two cases <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.88" href="#Vin.1.88"></a>
of manifestation of a serpent’s true nature.
<span class="rule">Monks, if an animal is not ordained, it should not be ordained; if it is

Now at that time a certain brahmin youth deprived his mother of life. He was
troubled about his evil deed, he was ashamed of it, loathed it. Then it
occurred to that brahmin youth: “Now, by what means could I get rid of this
evil deed?” Then it occurred to this brahmin youth: “These recluses, sons of
the Sakyans, are <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-farers, even-farers Brahma-farers, they are truth-speakers, of moral habit, of
good conduct. Now, if I were to go forth among these recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, so would I get rid of this evil deed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.64.2" href="#Kd.1.64.2"></a>
Then that brahmin youth, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going
forth. The monks spoke thus to the venerable Upāli: “Formerly, indeed, reverend
Upāli, a serpent in the form of a brahmin youth went forth among the monks.
Please, reverend Upāli, examine this brahmin youth.” Then as that brahmin youth
was being examined by the venerable Upāli he told him this matter. The
venerable Upāli told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>

Sāvatthī. Thieves, having issued forth on the road, robbed some monks and
killed other monks. Those in the royal service, having set out from Sāvatthī,
caught some thieves (but) other thieves ran away. Those who ran away went forth
among the monks; those who were caught were led off to execution.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.66.2" href="#Kd.1.66.2"></a>
Those who had gone forth saw those thieves being led off to execution; seeing

been killed likewise.”

<h2>The story of guidance for the unconscientious</h2>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.117" href="#BD.4.117"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks gave guidance to those who were
unconscientious. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, guidance should not be given to those who are unconscientious. Whoever
should give it to (any such), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

<p>Now at that time monks lived under the guidance of those who were
unconscientious; these soon also became unconscientious, depraved monks. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, one should not live under the guidance of those who are unconscientious.

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.1.72"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.72.2" href="#Kd.1.72.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “It is laid down by the Lord that guidance
should not be given to those who are unconscientious, and that one should not
live under the guidance of those who are unconscientious. Now, how are we to
know who is conscientious or who is unconscientious?” They told this matter to
the Lord. He said:</p>

Now at that time a certain monk was going along a highroad in the Kosala
country. Then it occurred to that monk: “It is laid down by the Lord that one
should not live independently. I am in need of guidance but I am going along a
high-road. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.73.2" href="#Kd.1.73.2"></a>
Now at that time two monks were going along a high-road in the Kosala country.
These arrived at a certain residence, and there one monk became ill. Then it
occurred to that ill monk: “It is laid down by the Lord that one should not
live independently. I am in need of guidance, but I am ill. Now <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.118" href="#BD.4.118"></a>

Then it occurred to that monk who was tending the ill one: “It is laid down by
the Lord … I am in need of guidance but this monk is ill. Now what line of
conduct should be followed by me?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow a monk, monks, if he is tending an ill one and is not receiving

Now at that time a certain monk was staying in a forest and there came to be
comfort for him in this lodging. Then it occurred to this monk: “It is laid
down by the Lord that one should not live independently. I am in need of
guidance, but I am staying in a forest and there comes to be comfort for me in
this lodging. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?” They told
this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow a monk, monks, if he is a forest-dweller and is thinking about abiding

Now at that time (a person) wished for ordination from the venerable Kassapa
the Great. Then the venerable Kassapa the Great sent a message to the venerable
Ānanda, saying: “Let Ānanda come, he will proclaim this (person).” The <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.119" href="#BD.4.119"></a>
venerable Ānanda spoke thus:</p>
<p>“I am not able to pronounce the elder’s name (for) the elder is my teacher.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.93" href="#Vin.1.93"></a>

Now at that time there were those wishing for ordination from several elders.
These quarrelled, saying: “I will be ordained first, I will be ordained first.”
The elders spoke thus: “Come, your reverences, we are making all the
proclamations together.” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make two or three proclamations together if there is one

Now at that time the venerable Kassapa the Boy became ordained twenty years
after his conception. Then it occurred to the venerable Kassapa the Boy: “It is
laid down by the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.120" href="#BD.4.120"></a>
Lord that an individual who is under twenty years of age should not be
ordained, and I am twenty years from my conception. Now am I ordained or am I
not ordained?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“When in his mother’s womb the first thought has arisen, the first
consciousness appeared, his birth is (to be reckoned as) from that time. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to ordain one who is twenty years of age from his

Now at that time ordained (monks) were to be seen who were (afflicted by)
leprosy and boils and eczema and consumption and epilepsy. They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when one is being ordained to ask him about things which
are stumbling-blocks for him. And thus, monks, should he be asked: Have you
diseases like this: leprosy, boils, eczema, consumption, epilepsy? Are you a
human being? Are you a man? Are you a freeman? Are you without debts? Are you
not in the royal service? Have you your parents’ consent? Are you full twenty
years of age? Are you complete as to bowl and robes? What is your name? What is
the name of your preceptor?”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.76.2" href="#Kd.1.76.2"></a>
Now at that time monks asked those wishing for ordination, but who were not
instructed, about the things which are stumbling-blocks. Those wishing for
ordination were at a loss, they were abashed, they were unable to reply. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having instructed first, afterwards <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.94" href="#Vin.1.94"></a>
to ask about the things which are stumbling-blocks.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.76.3" href="#Kd.1.76.3"></a>
They instructed just there in the midst of the Order. As before, those wishing
for ordination were at a loss, they were abashed, they were unable to reply.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.121" href="#BD.4.121"></a>
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having instructed aside, to ask about the things which are
stumbling-blocks in the midst of the Order. And thus, monks, should one be
instructed: First, he should be invited to choose a preceptor; having invited
him to choose a preceptor, a bowl and robes should be pointed out to him (with
the words): <span class="kamma">‘This is a bowl for you, this is an outer cloak, this is an upper robe, this is
an inner robe; go and stand in such and such a place’</span>.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.76.4" href="#Kd.1.76.4"></a>
Ignorant, inexperienced (monks) instructed them. Those wishing for ordination,
but who were not (properly) instructed, were at a loss, they were abashed, they
were unable to reply. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, one should not be instructed by an ignorant, inexperienced (monk).
Whoever (such) should instruct, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to instruct by means of an experienced, competent monk.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.76.5" href="#Kd.1.76.5"></a>
Those who were not agreed upon instructed. They told this matter to the Lord.

(such) should instruct, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to instruct by means of one who is agreed upon.</span> And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon: oneself may be agreed upon by
oneself or another may be agreed upon by another. And how is oneself to be

competent monk, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order hear me. So and so wishes for ordination from the

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.76.8" href="#Kd.1.76.8"></a>
They arrived together. They should not arrive together. The instructor having
come first, the Order should be informed by him, saying: <span class="kamma">“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. So and so wishes for ordination
from the venerable so and so. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.95" href="#Vin.1.95"></a>
He has been instructed by me. If it seems right to the Order, let so and so
come.”</span> He should be told:
<span class="kamma">“Come.”</span> Having made him arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, having made him
honour the monks’ feet, having made him sit down on his haunches, having made
him salute with joined palms, he should be made to ask for ordination, saying:
<span class="kamma">“Honoured sirs, I ask the Order for ordination; honoured sirs, may the Order
raise me up out of compassion. And a second time, honoured sirs, … And a third
time, honoured sirs, I ask the Order for ordination; honoured sirs, may the

<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.96" href="#Vin.1.96"></a>
the four resources should be explained (with the words): ‘Going forth is on
account of meals of scraps … <span class="add">

<p class="end">Told are the Four Resources</p>
<h2>Four things not to be done</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs=empty" id="Kd.1.78"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.78.1" href="#Kd.1.78.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, having ordained a certain monk, went away leaving him
alone. Afterwards as he was going along alone, he met his former wife on the
way. She spoke thus: “What, have you now gone forth?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have gone forth.” She said:</p>
<p>“Sexual intercourse is difficult for those who have gone forth. Come and
indulge in sexual intercourse.” Having indulged in sexual intercourse with her,
he arrived late. Monks spoke thus: “What were you, your reverence, doing for
such a long time?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.78.2" href="#Kd.1.78.2"></a>
Then this monk told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having ordained (a monk), to give him a companion and to
explain four things which are not to be done.</span> When a monk is ordained he should not indulge in sexual intercourse, even with
an animal. Whatever monk indulges in sexual intercourse, he becomes not a
(true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. As a man with his head cut off could
not become one to live by that bodily connection, even so a monk, having
indulged in sexual intercourse, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the
Sakyans. This is a thing not to be done by you as long as life lasts.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.78.3" href="#Kd.1.78.3"></a>
“When a monk is ordained he should not take by theft what has not been given,
even if it is only a blade of grass. Whatever monk takes by theft a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> or the worth of a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> or more than a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> that has not been given, he becomes not
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.125" href="#BD.4.125"></a>
a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. As a withered leaf, freed from its
stalk, could not become green again, even so a monk, having taken by theft a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> or the worth of a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> or more than a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> that was not given, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans.
This <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.97" href="#Vin.1.97"></a>
is a thing not to be done by you as long as life lasts.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.78.4" href="#Kd.1.78.4"></a>
“When a monk is ordained he should not intentionally deprive a living thing of
life, even if it is only an ant. Whatever monk deprives a human being of life
even down to causing abortion, he becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of
the Sakyans. As a flat stone, broken in half, becomes (something) not to be put
together again, even so a monk, having intentionally deprived a human being of
life, becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. This is a thing
not to be done by you as long as life lasts.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.1.78.5" href="#Kd.1.78.5"></a>
“When a monk is ordained he should not lay claim to a state of further-men,
even thinking: ‘I delight in solitude’. Whatever monk, of evil desires, filled
with covetousness, lays claim to a state of further-men which is non-existent,
not a fact—to meditation or to a deliverance or to contemplation or to an
attainment or to a way or to a fruit—he becomes not a (true) recluse, not a son
of the Sakyans. As a palmyra palm, cut off at the crown, could not become one
for further growth, even so a monk, of evil desires, filled with covetousness,
having claimed a state of further-men which is nonexistent, not a fact, becomes
not a (true) recluse, not a son of the Sakyans. This is a thing not to be done
by you as long as life lasts.”</p>

Order, (but) having come back again, he <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.126" href="#BD.4.126"></a>

As to great matters in the Vinaya, <br>
to bringing ease to the well-behaved <br>
both in restraint of evil desires and in strivings for conscientiousness,<br>
And also bearing in mind the instruction <br>
which is within the range of the all-knowing conqueror,<br>
in a realm which has no other, <br>
in peace from bondage, <br>
in what is well laid down, <br>
in that which has no doubt,<br>
In Section in Vinaya, as well as in Parivāra and in Heading(s), <br>
the good follows closely as though imitating.<br>
Who does not understand cattle does not guard the herd, <br>
so not knowing moral habit, how can he guard restraint?<br>
Although the Suttantas and Abhidhamma be forgotten, <br>
for all time
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.99" href="#Vin.1.99"></a>
the teaching persists while Vinaya is not destroyed.<br>
Therefore, because firmly supported, <br>
I will declare the key in regular sequence according to (my) knowledge. <br>
Listen while I speak.<br>
The matter, the provenance, the offence, the methods and the abbreviations—<br>
it is not easy not to leave something out; <br>
discern that from the method.<br>
Awakening, and the Rājāyatana, the Goatherds’, Sahampati<br>
Brahmā, Āḷara, Uddaka, and monks, Upaka the seer,<br>
Koṇḍañña, Vappa, Bhaddiya and Mahānāma, Assaji,<br>
Yasa, four, fifty, all, he sent out (on tour), the quarters,<br>
The subject, as to Māra, and the thirty, at Uruvelā, three matted hair
ascetics, <br>
fire-room, the Great Kings, Sakka, and Brahmā, the entire (population),<br>
Rag-robe, a tank, and a stone, <i lang="pi">kakudha</i>-(tree), a stone, a rose-apple, and a mango, <br>
emblic myrobalam, he brought a flower from the Coral Tree,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.128" href="#BD.4.128"></a>
<br>
‘Kassapa, let them be chopped, let them be kindled, and let them be
extinguished’,<br>
they plunged into, fire-vessels, rain, Gayā, and the Palm Grove, (King of)
Magadha,<br>
Upatissa, Kolita, and distinguished (young men), the going forth,<br>
wrongly dressed, dismissal, and the lean wretched brahmin,<br>
He indulged in bad habits, the stomach, the brahmin youth, a group,<br>
year’s standing, by the ignorant, going away, ten years’ standing, guidance, <br>
They did not conduct themselves (properly), to dismiss, ignorant,
nullification, five, six,<br>
and whoever else, and naked, not with (his hair) cut off, matted hair ascetic,
a Sakyan.<br>
Five diseases among the Magadhese, service, a thief (and) fingers,<br>
and (the King of) Magadha decreed, jail, written about, scourged,<br>
Branded, debtor, and a slave, close-shaving, Upāli, snake (-wind disease),<br>
a family with faith, and Kaṇḍaka, and then crowded up,<br>
About how to live, the boy, trainings, and they were, Now how?<br>
entire, by mouth, preceptors, luring away, Kaṇḍaka,<br>
Eunuch, theft, going over to, and a snake, on a mother, a father,<br>
perfected ones, a nun, schismatic, concerning blood, hermaphrodite,<br>
Without a preceptor, through an Order, a group, eunuch, <br>
without a bowl,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.129" href="#BD.4.129"></a>
without a robe, both these, then those three on what was lent,<br>
Hands, feet, hands and feet, ears, nose, both these, <br>
fingers, nails, tendons, webbed hands, and a hunch-back, dwarf,<br>
Having goitre, and then a branded one, scourged, written about, elephantiasis,<br>
badly (ill), and one who disgraces an assembly, blind, <br>
and just then one with a crooked limb,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.100" href="#Vin.1.100"></a>
<br>
And then a lame one, paralysed down one side, <br>
with a cripple, old age, blind from birth, dumb, deaf, blind and dumb, and what
is thereto,<br>
Whatever is called blind and dumb, and then dumb and deaf, <br>
And blind and dumb and deaf, <br>
and guidance to the unconscientious,<br>
And one should (not) live, what is done on a journey, being asked, wishing
for,<br>
‘let him come’, they quarrelled, if there is one preceptor, Kassapa,<br>
And ordained (monks) were to be seen pressing about diseases,<br>
the uninstructed were at a loss, instruction just there, <br>
And then in the Order, then an ignorant one, and not agreed upon,<br>
together, the ‘may-it-raise-(me-)up’ ordination, resource, alone, the three.<br>
In this Section are one hundred and seventy-two items.</p>
