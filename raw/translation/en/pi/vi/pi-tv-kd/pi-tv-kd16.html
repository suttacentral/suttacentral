<h3>Allowance for dwellings</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.1.1" href="#Kd.16.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.204" href="#BD.5.204"></a>
At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo
Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time lodgings had not been
permitted to monks by the Lord. So these monks stayed here and there: in a
forest, at the root of a tree, on a hillside, in a glen, in a mountain cave, in
a cemetery, in a forest glade, in the open air, on a heap of straw. Early in
the mornings these went out from this and that place: from the forest … from
the heap of straw, pleasing when approaching and when receding, when looking
before, when looking back, when bending back (their arms), when stretching them
out, their eyes cast down and possessed of pleasant behaviour.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.1.2" href="#Kd.16.1.2"></a>
Now at that time a (great) merchant of Rājagaha went early one morning to a
pleasure grove. The (great) merchant of Rājagaha saw these monks going out from
this and that place: from a forest … from a heap of straw, and seeing them he
made up his mind. Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha approached those monks;
having approached, he spoke thus to those monks: “If I, revered sirs, were to
have dwelling-places built, would you stay in my dwelling-places?”</p>
<p>“Householder, dwelling-places have not been allowed by the Lord.”</p>
<p>“Well then, revered sirs, having inquired of the Lord, tell me (what he says).”</p>
<p>“Very well, householder,” and these monks, having answered the (great) merchant
of Rājagaha in assent, approached the Lord; having approached the Lord, having
greeted him, they sat down at a respectful distance. As they were sitting down
at a respectful distance, these monks spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, the
(great) merchant of Rājagaha is anxious to have <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.205" href="#BD.5.205"></a>
dwelling-places built. What line of conduct should be followed by us, Lord?”
Then the Lord on this occasion having given reasoned talk addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, five (kinds of) abodes: a dwelling-place, a curved house, a
long house, a mansion, a cave.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.1.3" href="#Kd.16.1.3"></a>
Then
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.147" href="#Vin.2.147"></a>
these monks approached the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached,
they spoke thus to the (great) merchant of Rājagaha: “Householder,
dwelling-places have been allowed by the Lord. Do now what seems right.” Then
the (great) merchant of Rājagaha had sixty dwelling-places established on one
day alone. When the (great) merchant of Rājagaha had had these sixty
dwelling-places finished he approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, the (great) merchant of Rājagaha spoke thus to the
Lord: “Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with
the Order of monks.” The Lord consented by becoming silent. Then the (great)
merchant of Rājagaha, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his
seat departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.1.4" href="#Kd.16.1.4"></a>
Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having had sumptuous foods, solid and
soft, prepared towards the end of that night, had the time announced to the
Lord, saying: “It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.” Then the Lord, having
dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the dwelling of
the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached, he sat down on the
appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then the (great) merchant of
Rājagaha, having with his own hand served and satisfied the Order of monks with
the Awakened One at its head with sumptuous foods, solid and soft, sat down at
a respectful distance when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from
his bowl. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the (great) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.206" href="#BD.5.206"></a>
merchant of Rājagaha spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, I had these sixty
dwelling-places built because I need merit, because I need heaven. What line of
conduct am I, Lord, to follow in regard to these dwelling-places?”</p>
<p>“Well now, do you, householder, establish these sixty dwelling-places for (the
use of) the Order of the four quarters, present and to come.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having answered the
Lord in assent, had those sixty dwelling-places established for (the use of)
the Order of the four quarters, present and to come.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.1.5" href="#Kd.16.1.5"></a>
Then the Lord thanked the (great) merchant of Rājagaha in these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“They ward off cold and heat and beasts of prey from there<br>
And creeping things and gnats and rains in the wet season.<br>
When the dreaded hot wind arises, that is warded off.<br>
To meditate and obtain insight in a refuge and at ease:—</p>
<p>“A dwelling-place is praised by the Awakened One as chief gift to an Order.
<br>
Therefore a wise man, looking to his own weal,<br>
Should have charming dwelling-places built <br>
so that those who have heard much can stay therein.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.148" href="#Vin.2.148"></a></p>
<p>“To these food and drink, raiment and lodgings<br>
He should give, to the upright, with mind purified.<br>
(Then) these teach him <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> dispelling every ill;<br>
He, knowing that <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, here attains <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>, canker-
less.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Lord, having given thanks to the (great) merchant of Rājagaha in these
verses, rising from his seat, departed.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.2.1" href="#Kd.16.2.1"></a>
People heard: “It is said that dwelling-places are allowed by the Lord,” and
they zealously had dwelling-places built. These dwelling-places did not have
doors, and snakes, scorpions and centipedes got in. They told this matter to
the Lord. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.207" href="#BD.5.207"></a>
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a door.</span>” Having made a hole in the wall, they tied on the door with jungle creeper and
with cord, but these were eaten by rats and white ants and when the tyings were
eaten the doors fell down. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a doorpost and lintel, a hollow like a mortar (for the door to

cold weather, hot in the hot weather. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having lashed on (a roofing), to give it a smearing inside
and out.</span>” Now at that time dwelling-places had no windows. They were bad for the eyes
and nasty smelling. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, three (kinds of) windows: a railing window, a lattice window, a
stick window.</span>” Squirrels and bats got through the spaces
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.208" href="#BD.5.208"></a>

Now at that time monks lay down to sleep on the ground and their limbs and
robes were soiled with dust. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a grass matting.</span>” The grass matting

was eaten by rats and white ants. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a solid bench.</span>” Because of the solid bench their limbs became painful. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a little couch of split bamboo.</span>”</p>

Now at that time the group of six monks lay down to sleep on high couches.
People touring the lodgings, having seen them … spread it about, saying: “Like
householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses.” They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, you should not lie down to sleep on high couches. Whoever should (so)
lie down to sleep, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.150" href="#Vin.2.150"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to have a long house
with a smearing of plaster and clay built for an Order. Then it occurred to
monks: “Now what kind of roofing is allowed by the Lord, what is not allowed?”
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, five (kinds of) roofings: a roofing of tiles, a roofing of
stones, a roofing of plaster, a roofing of <i lang="pi">tiṇa</i>-grass, a roofing of leaves.</span>”</p>

<h3>The story of Anāthapiṇḍika</h3>
<p>Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was the husband of a sister of a
(great) merchant of Rājagaha. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went to
Rājagaha on some business or other. At that time the Order with the Awakened
One at its head had been invited for the morrow by the (great) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.217" href="#BD.5.217"></a>
merchant of Rājagaha. Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha enjoined slaves and
servants, saying: “Well now, good people, getting up early in the morning, cook
conjeys, cook rice, prepare curries, prepare vegetables.” Then it occurred to
the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “Now, on my arrival formerly this householder,
having put aside all duties, did nothing except exchange greetings with me, but
now he seems excited and enjoins slaves and servants, saying: ‘Well now, good
people … <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.155" href="#Vin.2.155"></a>
prepare vegetables.’ Now can there be for this householder a leading to (a
bride’s home) or can there be a leading away from (a bride’s home) or is a
great oblation arranged or is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha invited for the
morrow together with his troops?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.2" href="#Kd.16.4.2"></a>
Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha, having enjoined the slaves and servants,
approached the householder Anāthapiṇḍika; having approached, having exchanged
greetings with the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, he sat down at a respectful
distance. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the (great) merchant of
Rājagaha as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: “Formerly you,
householder, on my arrival, having put aside all duties, did nothing except
exchange greetings with me, but now you seem excited and enjoin slaves and
servants, saying: ‘Well now, good people … prepare vegetables.’ Now can there
be for you, householder, a leading to … or is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
invited for the morrow together with his troops?”</p>
<p>“There is to be for me, householder, neither a leading to (a bride’s home), nor
is there to be a leading away from (a bride’s home), nor is King Seniya
Bimbisāra of Magadha invited for the morrow together with his troops. But a
great oblation is arranged by me: the Order is invited for the morrow with the
Awakened One at its head.”</p>
<p>“Did you, householder, say ‘Awakened One?’”</p>
<p>“‘Awakened One’ I did say, householder.”</p>
<p>“Did you, householder, say ‘Awakened One’?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.218" href="#BD.5.218"></a>
“‘Awakened One’ I did say, householder.”</p>
<p>“Did you, householder, say ‘Awakened One’?”</p>
<p>“‘Awakened One’ I did say, householder.”</p>
<p>“Even this sound, householder, is hard to come by in the world, that is to say
‘Awakened One, Awakened One.’ Now would it be possible, householder, at this
time to go up and see this Lord, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened One?”</p>
<p>“This time is not a right time, householder, to go up and see this Lord, a
perfected one, a fully Self-awakened One. But now, early Tomorrow you shall go
up to see this Lord, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened One.”</p>
<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking: “Early Tomorrow I will go up to
see this Lord … fully Self-Awakened One,” lay down with mindfulness (so much)
directed to the Awakened One, that he got up three times during the night
thinking it was daybreak.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.3" href="#Kd.16.4.3"></a>
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the gateway to the Cool Grove,
and non-human beings opened the gateway. Then as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika
was going out from the town, light vanished, darkness appeared; fear,
consternation, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.156" href="#Vin.2.156"></a>
hair standing on end arose so that he was desirous of turning back from there.
Then the <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> Sīvaka, invisible, made this sound heard:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“A hundred elephants, a hundred horses, a hundred chariots with she-mules,<br>
A hundred thousand maidens adorned with jewelled earrings—<br>
These are not worth the sixteenth part of one length of stride.<br>
Advance, householder, advance, householder.<br>
Advance is better for you, not retreat.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then darkness vanished for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, light appeared, so
that his fear, consternation, hair standing on end subsided. And a second time
… And a third time <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.219" href="#BD.5.219"></a>
did the <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> Sīvaka made this sound heard: “… Advance is better for you, not retreat.” And
a third time darkness vanished for the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, light
appeared, so that his fear, consternation, hair standing on end subsided.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.4" href="#Kd.16.4.4"></a>
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Cool Grove. Now at that time
the Lord was pacing up and down in the open air, having got up in the night
towards dawn. Then the Lord saw the householder Anāthapiṇḍika coming in the
distance; seeing him, having stepped down from the place for pacing up and down
in, he sat down on an appointed seat, and sitting down the Lord spoke thus to
the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “Come, Sudatta.” Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking: “The Lord addressed me by name,” joyful, elated,
approached the Lord; having approached, having inclined his head to the Lord’s
feet, he spoke thus to the Lord: “I hope, Lord, that the Lord is living at
ease.” He said:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Yes, always at ease he lives, the brahmin, attained to <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>,<br>
Who is not stained by lusts, cooled, without attachments.<br>
Having rent all clingings, having averted heart’s care, <br>
Tranquil he lives at ease, having won to peace of mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.5" href="#Kd.16.4.5"></a>
Then the Lord talked a progressive talk to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, that
is to say talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven, he explained the
peril, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures of the senses, the advantage in
renouncing (them). When the Lord knew that the mind of the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika was ready, malleable, devoid of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.220" href="#BD.5.220"></a>
the hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to him that teaching on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> which the awakened ones have themselves discovered: ill, uprising, stopping,
the Way. And as a clean <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.157" href="#Vin.2.157"></a>
cloth without black specks will easily take dye, even so as he was (sitting) on
that very seat, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, that
“whatever is liable to uprising, all that is liable to stopping.” Then the
householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, plunged into <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having crossed over doubt, having put away uncertainty, having attained
without another’s help to full confidence in the Teacher’s instruction, spoke
thus to the Lord:</p>
<p>“Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Even, Lord, as one might set upright what
has been upset, or might uncover what was concealed, or might show the way to
one who is astray, or might bring an oil lamp into the darkness, thinking,
‘Those with eyes to see may see shapes,’ even so is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> explained in many a figure by the Lord. I myself, Lord, go to the Lord for
refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and to the Order of monks. May the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple going for
refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts. And, Lord, may the Lord
consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks.” The
Lord consented by becoming silent. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having
understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord,
departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.6" href="#Kd.16.4.6"></a>
The (great) merchant of Rājagaha heard: “It is said that the Order with the
Awakened One at its head is invited for the morrow by the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika.” Then the (great) merchant of Rājagaha spoke thus to the
householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “It is said, that the Order with the Awakened One at
its head is invited by you, householder, for the morrow. But you are incoming.
I can give you, householder, the means by which you can make a meal for the
Order with the Awakened One at its head.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, householder, but I have the means by which I can make a meal for
the Order with the Awakened One at, its head.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.221" href="#BD.5.221"></a>
The urban council of Rajagana heard: “The Order with the Awakened One at its
head is invited for the morrow by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika.” Then the
urban council of Rājagaha spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “It is
said that the Order … We can give you, householder, the means by which you can
make a meal for the Order with the Awakened One at its head.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, masters, but I have the means … at its head.”</p>
<p>King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: “The Order …” …</p>
<p>“Thank you, sire, but I have the means by which I can make a meal for the Order
with the Awakened One at its head.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.7" href="#Kd.16.4.7"></a>
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft,
prepared towards the end of that night in the dwelling of the (great) merchant
of Rājagaha, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.158" href="#Vin.2.158"></a>
had the time announced to the Lord, saying: “It is time, Lord, the meal is
ready.” Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe,
approached the dwelling of the (great) merchant of Rājagaha; having approached,
he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then the
householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having with his own hand served and satisfied with
sumptuous foods, solid and soft, the Order of monks with the Awakened One at
its head, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat
down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, may the Lord
consent to a rains-residence from me at Sāvatthī together with the Order of
monks.”</p>
<p>“But, householder, Truth-finders delight in empty places.”</p>
<p>“It is understood, Lord, it is understood, Well-farer.” Then the Lord, having
gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with talk
on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, departed.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.8" href="#Kd.16.4.8"></a>
Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends, many
companions, his word carried weight. Then <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.222" href="#BD.5.222"></a>
the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having concluded that business at Rājagaha, set
out for Sāvatthī. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika enjoined people on the
way, saying: “Masters, build monasteries, prepare dwelling-places, furnish
gifts; an Awakened One has arisen in the world, and this Lord, invited by me,
will come along by this road.”</p>
<p>Then these people, urged on by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, built
monasteries, prepared dwelling-places, furnished gifts. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika, having arrived at Sāvatthī, looked all round Sāvatthī, thinking:
“Now where could the Lord stay that would be neither too far from a village,
nor too near, suitable for coming and going, accessible to people whenever they
want, not crowded by day, having little noise at night, little sound, without
folks’ breath, secluded from people, fitting for meditation?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.9" href="#Kd.16.4.9"></a>
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika saw Prince Jeta’s pleasure grove, neither
too far from a village … fitting for meditation, and seeing it, he approached
Prince Jeta; having approached he spoke thus to Prince Jeta: “Give me, young
master, the pleasure grove to make a monastery.”</p>
<p>“The pleasure grove is not to be given away, householder, even for the price of
a hundred thousand.”</p>
<p>“Young master, the monastery is taken.”</p>
<p>“The monastery is not taken, householder.” They asked the chief ministers of
justice, saying: “Is it taken or is it not taken?” The chief ministers spoke
thus: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.159" href="#Vin.2.159"></a>
“The monastery is taken at the price fixed by you, young master.” Then the
householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having had gold coins brought out by means of
wagons, had the Jeta Grove spread with the price of a hundred thousand.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.4.10" href="#Kd.16.4.10"></a>
The gold coins that were taken out the first time were not enough for a small
open space near to the porch. Then the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.223" href="#BD.5.223"></a>
householder Anāthapiṇḍika enjoined the people, saying: “Go back, good people,
bring (more) gold coins, I will spread this open space.” Then it occurred to
Prince Jeta: “Now this can be no ordinary matter inasmuch as this householder
bestows so many gold coins,” and he spoke thus to the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>
<p>“Enough, householder; let me spread this open space, give this open space to
me, it will be my gift.”</p>
<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, thinking: “This Prince Jeta is a
distinguished, well-known man; surely the faith in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline of well-known men like this is very efficacious,” made over
that open space to Prince Jeta. Then Prince Jeta built a porch on that open
space. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika had dwelling-places made, he had cells
made … porches … attendance halls … fire halls … huts for what is allowable …
privies … places for pacing up and down in … halls in the places for pacing up
and down in … wells … halls at the wells … bathrooms … halls in the bathrooms …
lotus ponds … he had sheds made.</p>
<h3>Giving building work</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.5.1" href="#Kd.16.5.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Vesālī. In due course, walking on tour, he arrived at Vesālī.
The Lord stayed there at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Hall of the Gabled
Pillars. Now at that time people were making repairs carefully and they were
also attending carefully, with the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings and
medicines for the sick, to those monks who were looking after the repairs. Then
it occurred to a certain poor tailor: “Now this can be no ordinary matter
inasmuch as these people are making repairs carefully. What now if I too should
make repairs?” Then that poor tailor, having himself kneaded mud, having piled
up bricks, had wattle and daub walls erected. But because he was not skilful
the piling was crooked and a wall fell down. And a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.224" href="#BD.5.224"></a>
second time … And a third time … a wall fell down.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.5.2" href="#Kd.16.5.2"></a>
Then that poor tailor … spread it about, saying: “These recluses,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.160" href="#Vin.2.160"></a>
sons of the Sakyans, exhort, instruct those who give them the requisites of
robes, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick, and these look after their
repairs. But I am poor. No one exhorts or instructs me or looks after my
repairs.” Monks heard this poor tailor as he was … spreading it about. Then
these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in
this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to put repairs in charge (of a monk). Monks, the monk who
is in charge of repairs should make an effort, thinking, ‘How can the
dwelling-place be brought to a rapid termination?’ and he should restore broken
and dilapidated parts.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.5.3" href="#Kd.16.5.3"></a>
“And thus, monks, should they be given in charge: First, a monk should be
asked; having asked him, the Order should be informed by an experienced,
competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, let
the Order give the repairs to the dwelling-place of the householder So-and-so
in charge of the monk So-and-so. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the
Order listen to me. The Order is giving the repairs … in charge of the monk
So-and-so. If the giving in charge of the monk So-and-so, of the repairs to the
dwelling-place of the householder So-and-so, is pleasing to the venerable ones,
they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. Repairs to
the dwelling-place of the householder So-and-so are given in charge of the monk
So-and-so. It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I
understand this</span>’.”</p>
<h2>Allowance for the first seat, etc.</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.6"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.6.1" href="#Kd.16.6.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Vesālī for as long as he found suiting, set out
on tour for Sāvatthī. Now at that time monks who were pupils of the group of
six monks, having gone <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.225" href="#BD.5.225"></a>
along in front of the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, took
possession of dwelling-places, they took possession of sleeping places, saying:
“This will be for our preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be
for us.” Then the venerable Sāriputta, having gone along close behind the Order
of monks with the Awakened One at its head, not being able to get a sleeping
place—the dwelling-places being taken possession of, the sleeping places being
taken possession of—sat down at the root of a certain tree. Then the Lord,
getting up during the night towards morning, coughed. The venerable Sāriputta
also coughed.</p>
<p>“Who is there?”</p>
<p>“It is I, Lord, Sāriputta.”</p>
<p>“Why are you, Sāriputta, sitting here?” Then the venerable Sāriputta told this
matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.6.2" href="#Kd.16.6.2"></a>
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: “Is it true, as is said, monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.161" href="#Vin.2.161"></a>
that monks who are pupils … ‘… this will be for us’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men, having gone along in front of … saying ‘…
this will be for us’? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased …” And having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed
the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Who, monks, is worthy of the best seat, the best water (for washing), the best
alms?” Some monks spoke thus: “Whoever, Lord, has gone forth from a noble
family, he is worthy of the best … alms.” Some monks spoke thus: “Whoever,
Lord, has gone forth from a brahmin family … from a householder’s family …
Whoever, Lord, knows the <i lang="pi">suttantas</i> … is an expert on discipline … is a teacher of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … is possessed of the first meditation … is possessed of the second meditation
… is possessed of the third meditation … is possessed of the fourth meditation
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.226" href="#BD.5.226"></a>
… is a stream winner … a once-returner … a non-returner … one perfected … a
threefold wisdom man … a sixfold superknowledge man, he is worthy of the best
seat, the best water (for washing), the best alms.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.6.3" href="#Kd.16.6.3"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Formerly, monks, there used to be a
large banyan on a slope of the Himalayas. Three friends lived near it: a
partridge, a monkey and a bull-elephant. These lived courteous, deferential,
polite to one another. Then, monks, it occurred to these friends: ‘Now let us
find out which of us is the eldest by birth. We should respect, revere,
reverence, honour him, and we should abide by his advice.’ Then, monks, the
partridge and the monkey asked the bull-elephant: ‘You, friend, what long-ago
thing do you remember?’</p>
<p>“‘When I, friends, was young I used to pass over this banyan keeping it between
my thighs, and the topmost shoots brushed against my belly. This, friends, is a
long-ago thing that I remember.’</p>
<p>“Then, monks, the partridge and the bull-elephant asked the monkey: ‘You,
friend, what long-ago thing do you remember?’</p>
<p>“‘When I, friends, was young, having sat down on the ground, I used to eat the
topmost shoots of this banyan. This, friends, is a long-ago thing that I
remember.’</p>
<p>“Then, monks, the monkey and the bull-elephant asked the partridge: ‘You,
friend, what long-ago thing do you remember?’</p>
<p>“‘Friends, in a certain open space there was a great banyan. I, having eaten
one of its fruits, relieved myself in that open space, and this banyan has
grown from that. So I, friends, am the eldest by birth’. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.162" href="#Vin.2.162"></a>
</p>
<p>“Then, monks, the monkey and the bull-elephant spoke thus to the partridge:
‘You, friend, are the eldest of us by birth. We will respect, revere,
reverence, honour you and we will abide by your advice.’</p>
<p>“Then, monks, the partridge caused the monkey and the bull-elephant to
undertake the five moral habits and himself followed the observance of the five
moral habits. They, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.227" href="#BD.5.227"></a>
having lived courteous, deferential, polite to one another, at the breaking up
of the body after dying arose in a happy bourn, a heaven world. This, monks,
came to be known as the ‘Partridge Brahma-faring.’</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Those who reverence the old—<br>
those men are skilled in <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,<br>
Worthy of praise here and now <br>
and a happy bourn here-after.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.6.4" href="#Kd.16.6.4"></a>
“Well then, monks, if animals, breathers, can live courteous, deferential,
polite to one another, so do you, monks, let your light shine forth here so
that you, gone forth in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline which are well taught, live likewise courteous, deferential,
polite to one another. It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased …” Having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, greeting, rising up for, joining the palms in salutation,
proper homage, the best seat, the best water (for washing), the best alms
according to seniority. But, monks, what belongs to an Order should not be
reserved according to seniority. Whoever should (so) reserve it, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<h3>Persons not to be bowed to</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.6.5" href="#Kd.16.6.5"></a>
“Monks, there are these ten who are not to be greeted: one ordained later is
not to be greeted by one ordained earlier; one not ordained is not to be
greeted; one belonging to a different communion (even) if he is more senior
(yet) speaks what is not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is not to be greeted; a woman is not to be greeted; a eunuch … one under
probation … one who deserves to be sent back to the beginning … one who
deserves <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> … one undergoing <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> … one deserving rehabilitation is not to be greeted. These, ten, monks, are
not to be greeted. These three, monks, are to be greeted: one ordained earlier
is to be greeted by one ordained later; one belonging to a different communion
if he is more senior and speaks what is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is to be greeted; and, monks, a Truth-finder, a perfected one, a fully
Self-awakened one is to be greeted in the world with its <i lang="pi">devas</i>, with its Māras, with its
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.228" href="#BD.5.228"></a>
Brahmās, by creatures with recluses and brahmins, with <i lang="pi">devas</i> and mankind. These three, monks, are to be greeted.”</p>
<h3>Rejection of reserved seating</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.7"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.7.1" href="#Kd.16.7.1"></a>
Now at that time people prepared sheds for an Order, they prepared rugs, they
prepared open spaces. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.163" href="#Vin.2.163"></a>
Monks who were pupils of the group of six monks, saying: “Only what belongs to
an Order is not allowed according to seniority by the Lord, not what is made on
purpose for it,” having gone along in front of the Order of monks with the
Awakened One at its head, took possession of the sheds, took possession of the
rugs, took possession of the open spaces, thinking: “This will be for our
preceptors, this will be for our teachers, this will be for us.” Then the
venerable Sāriputta, having gone along close behind the Order of monks with the
Awakened One at its head, not having a chance to get an open space—the sheds
being taken possession of, the rugs being taken possession of, the open spaces
being taken possession of—sat down at the root of a certain tree. Then the
Lord, getting up during the night towards morning, coughed. The venerable
Sāriputta also coughed.</p>
<p>“Who is there?”</p>
<p>“It is I, Lord, Sāriputta.”</p>
<p>“Why are you, Sāriputta, sitting here?” Then the venerable Sāriputta told this
matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having
had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: “Is it true, as
is said, monks, …?” … Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, even what is made on purpose for an Order should not be reserved
according to seniority. Whoever should (so) reserve it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<h3>Allowance for what is displayed by householders</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.8"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.8.1" href="#Kd.16.8.1"></a>
Now at that time in a refectory inside a house people appointed high and broad
things to recline upon, that is to say: a sofa, a divan, a long-haired
coverlet, a many-coloured coverlet, a white coverlet, a wool coverlet besprent
with flowers, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.229" href="#BD.5.229"></a>
a cotton quilt, a wool coverlet decorated with animals forms, a wool covering
with hair on the upper side, a wool covering with hair at one side, a silken
sheet studded with jewels, a sheet made with silk thread and studded with
jewels, a dancer’s carpet, an elephant rug, a horse rug, a chariot rug, rugs of
black antelope skins, a splendid sheeting of the hide of the <i lang="pi">kadali</i>-deer, a sheet with an awning above, a couch with a red cushion at either end.
Monks, being scrupulous, did not sit down on them. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, except for the three: a sofa, a divan, a cotton quilt, to
sit down on what is displayed by householders, but not to lie down on it.</span>”</p>

<p>Now at that time in a refectory inside a house people appointed a couch and a
chair, both covered up with cotton. Monks, being scrupulous, did not sit down
on them. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sit down on what is displayed by householders, but not

<h3>Appreciation for the Jetavana monastery</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.9"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.9.1" href="#Kd.16.9.1"></a>
Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Sāvatthī. The Lord
stayed there at Sāvatthī <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.164" href="#Vin.2.164"></a>
in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the householder
Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord,
he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful
distance the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, may the
Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow together with the Order of monks.”
The Lord consented by becoming silent. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika,
having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat departed keeping his
right side towards him. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having had
sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared towards the end of that night, had
the time announced to the Lord, saying: “It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.”
Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe,
approached the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika; <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.230" href="#BD.5.230"></a>
having approached, he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of
monks. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having with his own hand served and
satisfied the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head with sumptuous
foods, solid and soft, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from
his bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance the householder Anāthapiṇḍika spoke thus to the Lord: “What
line of conduct am I, Lord, to follow in regard to the Jeta Grove?”</p>
<p>“Well now, do you, householder, have the Jeta Grove prepared for (the use of)
the Order of the four quarters, present and to come.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, having answered the Lord
in assent, had the Jeta Grove prepared for (the use of) the Order of the four
quarters, present and to come.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.9.2" href="#Kd.16.9.2"></a>
Then the Lord thanked the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in these verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“They ward off cold and heat and beasts of prey from there …
<br>
He, knowing that <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> here, attains <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>, cankerless.”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.165" href="#Vin.2.165"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Lord, having given thanks to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in these
verses, rising from his seat departed.</p>
<h3>Reservation of a seat, etc.</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.10"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.10.1" href="#Kd.16.10.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain chief minister who was a disciple of the Naked
Ascetics had a meal for an Order. The venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans, having arrived after (the others) while the meal was yet unfinished,
turned away the monk who was next to him, and there was an uproar in the
refectory. Then that chief minister … spread it about, saying: “How can these
recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having arrived after (the others) turn away
monks while a meal is yet unfinished so that there is an uproar in the
refectory? Now, is it not possible, even sitting somewhere else, to eat <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.231" href="#BD.5.231"></a>
as much as one pleases?” Monks heard this chief minister as he … spread it
about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the
venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having arrived after (the others),
turn away the monk who is next to him while the meal is yet unfinished so that
there is an uproar in the refectory?” Then these monks told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, having arrived … in the
refectory?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>How can you, foolish man, having arrived … in a refectory? It is not, foolish
man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” Having rebuked him, having
given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, a monk should not turn (another) away while a meal is yet unfinished.
Whoever should turn (another) away, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> If he turns (another) away who is invited (to the meal), he should be told,
‘Go and fetch water.’ If this is thus accomplished, that is good; if it is not
accomplished, having swallowed lumps of boiled rice properly, his seat should
be given to a senior monk. <span class="rule">But this I say, monks: that not by any method should a seat be reserved for a
senior monk. Whoever should reserve one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.10.2" href="#Kd.16.10.2"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks turned ill monks away. The ill ones
spoke thus: “We, your reverences, are not able to get up, we are ill.” Saying,
“We will turn the venerable ones away,” having taken hold of them, having
turned them away, they let go (of them) while they were standing. The ill ones,
on being let go of, fell down. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, one who is ill should not be turned away. Whoever should turn him away,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the group of six <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.166" href="#Vin.2.166"></a>
monks, saying: “We are ill, we are not to be turned away,” kept to the best
sleeping places. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give a suitable sleeping place to one who is ill.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the group of six monks reserved lodgings <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.232" href="#BD.5.232"></a>
on (some slight) pretext. They told this matter to the Lord He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, a lodging should not be reserved on (some slight) pretext. Whoever
should (so) reserve it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.11"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.11.1" href="#Kd.16.11.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of seventeen monks were repairing a large
dwelling-place in the neighbourhood, thinking: ‘We will spend the rains here.’
The group of six monks saw the group of seventeen monks as they were repairing
the dwelling-place, and seeing them, they spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, the group of seventeen monks are repairing a dwelling-place.
Come, we will turn them away.”</p>
<p>Some spoke thus: “Wait, your reverences, until they have repaired it; when it
is repaired, we will turn them away.” Then the group of six monks spoke thus to
the group of seventeen monks: “Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place was
obtained by us.”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, should not this have been explained before, and we would have
repaired another?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, does not a dwelling-place belong to the Order?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences, a dwelling-place belongs to the Order.”</p>
<p>“Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place was obtained by us.”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, the dwelling-place is big; you stay, and we too will stay.”</p>
<p>“Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place was obtained by us,” and angry,
displeased, having taken them by the throat, they threw them out. These being
thrown out, wept. Monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Why do you, your reverences, weep?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased, threw us out of a
dwelling-place belonging to the Order.” Those who were modest monks looked down
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can this group of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.233" href="#BD.5.233"></a>
six monks, angry, displeased, throw out monks from a dwelling-place belonging
to an Order?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks, angry, displeased,
threw out monks from a dwelling-place belonging to an Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, a monk should not be thrown out of a dwelling-place belonging to an
Order by one who is angry, displeased. Whoever (such) should throw him out
should be dealt with according to the rule.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assign lodgings.</span>”</p>
<h3>Agreement for an assigner of lodgings</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.11.2" href="#Kd.16.11.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “Now by whom should lodgings be assigned?”</p>
<p>They told this matter to the Lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.167" href="#Vin.2.167"></a>
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a monk endowed with five qualities as
assigner of lodgings: one who would not follow a wrong course through desire,
one who would not follow a wrong course through hatred, one who would not
follow a wrong course through stupidity, one who would not follow a wrong
course through fear, and one who would know what is taken and what is not
taken.</span> And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon: First, a monk should be asked.
Having asked him, the Order should be informed by an experienced, competent
monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, the
Order should agree upon the monk So-and-so as assigner of lodgings. This is the
motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The Order is agreeing upon
the monk So-and-so as assigner of lodgings. If the agreement upon the monk
So-and-so as assigner of lodgings is pleasing to the venerable ones, they
should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. The monk
So-and-so is agreed upon by the Order as assigner <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.234" href="#BD.5.234"></a>
of lodgings. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent. Thus do I
understand this</span>’.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.11.3" href="#Kd.16.11.3"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks who were the assigners of lodgings: “Now, how
should the lodgings be assigned?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, first to count the monks; having counted the monks, to
count the sleeping places; having counted the sleeping places, to assign
according to the accommodation for sleeping places.</span>” Assigning according to the accommodation for sleeping places (some) sleeping
places were left over. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assign according to the accommodation in
dwelling-places.</span>” Assigning according to the accommodation in dwelling-places (some)
dwelling-places were left over. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assign according to the accommodation in cells.</span>” Assigning according to the accommodation in cells (some) cells were left
over. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give an additional share also.</span>”</p>
<p>When an additional share had been occupied another monk arrived. “It need not
be given (to him if the occupier) is not willing.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks assigned lodgings to one who was standing outside a
boundary. They told this matter to the Lord. He said; “<span class="rule">Monks, a lodging should not be assigned to one standing outside a boundary.
Whoever should (so) assign it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks, having occupied lodgings, reserved them for all time.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “ <span class="rule">Monks, having occupied a lodging, it should not be reserved for all time.
Whoever should reserve it (thus), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to reserve <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.235" href="#BD.5.235"></a>
it for the three months of the rains but not to reserve it for the dry season.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.11.4" href="#Kd.16.11.4"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: “Now, how many (times for) the assignment of
lodgings are there?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there
are these three (times for) the assignment of lodgings: the earlier, the later,
the intervening. The earlier on which they are to be assigned is the day
following the full moon of Āsāḷha; the later on which they are to be assigned
is the month following the full moon of Āsāḷha; the intervening on which they
are to be assigned is the day following the Invitation, with reference to the
next rains-residence. These, monks, are the three (times for) the assignment of
lodgings.”</p>
<p class="end">The Second Portion for Repeating. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.168" href="#Vin.2.168"></a>
</p>
<h2>Third recitation section</h2>
<p>Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having
occupied a lodging in Sāvatthī, went away to some village residence and
occupied a lodging there too. Then it occurred to these monks: “Now your
reverences, this venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, is a maker of
strife, a maker of quarrels, a maker of contention, a maker of disputes, a
maker of legal questions in the Order. If he will spend the rains here, not one
of us can live in comfort. Come, let us ask him.” Then these monks spoke thus
to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans: “Have you not, reverend
Upananda, occupied a lodging in Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.”</p>
<p>“But do you, reverend Upananda, (although) alone reserve two (lodgings)?”</p>
<p>“I, your reverences, am giving up the one here and occupying the one there.”
Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.236" href="#BD.5.236"></a>
(although) alone reserve two (lodgings)?” They told this matter to the Lord.
Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of
monks convened, questioned the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans,
saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda … (lodgings)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, (although) alone reserve two (lodgings)? The one
occupied by you there, foolish man, is lost here, the one occupied by you here
is lost there. Thus are you, foolish man, excluded from both. It is not,
foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” … having given
reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Monks, two (lodgings) should not be reserved by one (monk). Whoever should
reserve (them), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.13"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.13.1" href="#Kd.16.13.1"></a>
Now at that time the Lord in many a figure talked a talk on discipline to the
monks, he spoke in praise of discipline, he spoke in praise of accomplishment
in discipline, he spoke in praise of the venerable Upāli, referring (to him)
again and again. Monks spoke thus: “The Lord in many a figure talked a talk on
discipline … he spoke in praise of the venerable Upāli, referring (to him)
again and again. Come, your reverences, let us master discipline under the
venerable Upāli,” and they, many monks—elders and newly ordained and those of
middle standing—mastered discipline under the venerable Upāli. The venerable
Upāli, out of respect for the monks who were elders, recited standing, and also
the monks who were elders, out of respect for <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, had it recited standing, so that the monks who were elders were tired as well
as the venerable Upāli. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.169" href="#Vin.2.169"></a>
when a newly ordained monk is reciting to sit down on a seat that is the same
(height) or on a higher one out of respect for <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; when a monk who is an elder
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.237" href="#BD.5.237"></a>
is having it recited to sit down on a seat that is the same (height) or on a
lower one out of respect for <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.13.2" href="#Kd.16.13.2"></a>
Now at that time many monks standing near the venerable Upāli grew tired
waiting for the recitation. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sit down with those entitled to seats of an equal
(height).</span>” Then it occurred to monks: “Now, in respect of what is one entitled to seats
of an equal (height)?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sit down together with those who are within three years
(of your) standing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time several monks entitled to seats of an equal (height), having
sat down on a couch, broke the couch; having sat down on a chair, they broke
the chair. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a couch for a group of three (persons), a chair for a group of
three (persons).</span>” But a group of three (people), having sat down on a couch, broke the couch;
having sat down on a chair, they broke the chair. “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a couch for a group of two (persons), a chair for a group of
two (persons).</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks were (too) scrupulous to sit down on a long seat with
those not entitled to a seat of an equal (height). They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, except with a eunuch, a woman, a hermaphrodite, to sit down
on a long seat with those not entitled to a seat of an equal (height).</span>” Then it occurred to the monks: “Now, what is the maximum (length) of a ‘long
seat’?”</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, the maximum (length) of a ‘long seat’ (to be) whatever is the
maximum (length) that suffices (to seat) three (persons).</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.14"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.14.1" href="#Kd.16.14.1"></a>
Now at that time Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, wanted to have a long house with a
verandah of the “elephant-nail” type built for an Order. Then it occurred to
the monks: “What appurtenances of a long house are allowed by the Lord, what
are not allowed?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, all the appurtenances of a long house.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.238" href="#BD.5.238"></a>
Now at that time the grandmother of King Pasenadi of Kosala passed away. On her
passing many unallowable goods accrued to an Order, that is to say a sofa, a
divan … a cotton quilt … a couch with a red cushion at either end. They told
this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, having broken off the legs of a sofa, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.170" href="#Vin.2.170"></a>
to make use of it; having destroyed the horse-hair (stuffing) of a divan, to
make use of it; having unravelled the cotton quilt, to make a squatting mat; to
make a ground covering with what is over.</span>”</p>
<h3>Things not to be disposed of</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.15"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.15.1" href="#Kd.16.15.1"></a>
Now at that time in a certain village residence not far from Sāvatthī the
resident monks were worried at preparing lodgings for the incoming monks who
arrived. Then it occurred to these monks: “At present we, your reverences, are
worried at preparing lodgings for incoming monks who arrive. Come, your
reverences, let us make over all the lodgings belonging to the Order to one
(monk) and we will make use of them as belonging to him.” So these made over to
one (monk) all the lodgings belonging to the Order. Incoming monks spoke thus
to these monks: “Make ready lodgings, your reverences, for us.”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, there are no lodgings belonging to the Order, we have made
them all over to one (monk).”</p>
<p>“But have you, your reverences, disposed of lodgings belonging to an Order?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:
“How can these monks dispose of what belongs to an Order?” They told this
matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.239" href="#BD.5.239"></a>
“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks disposed of lodgings belonging to an
Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men dispose of lodgings belonging to an Order?
It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having
rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.15.2" href="#Kd.16.15.2"></a>
“Monks, these five things not to be disposed of should not be disposed of by an
Order or by a group or by an individual—even if disposed of they are not
(really) disposed of. Whoever should dispose of them, there is a grave offence.
What are the five?</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="rule">A monastery, a site for a monastery. This is the first thing not to be disposed
of that should not be disposed of by an Order or by a group or by an

<li><span class="rule">A dwelling-place, a site for a dwelling-place. This is the second thing …</span></li>
<li><span class="rule">A couch, a chair, a mattress, a squatting mat. This is the third thing … </span></li>

<h3>Things not to be distributed</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.16.16"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.16.1" href="#Kd.16.16.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he found suiting,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.171" href="#Vin.2.171"></a>
set out on tour for Kiṭāgiri with a large Order of monks, with at least five
hundred monks and with Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Then the monks who were <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.240" href="#BD.5.240"></a>
followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka heard: “They say that the Lord has arrived
at Kiṭāgiri with a large Order of monks … and with Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
Come, your reverences, let us distribute all the lodgings belonging to the
Order. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are of depraved desires, they are under the
influence of depraved desires; we will not make ready lodgings for them.” They
distributed all the lodgings belonging to the Order. Then the Lord, walking on
tour, gradually reached Kiṭāgiri. Then the Lord addressed several monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“Do you go, monks, and having gone up to the monks who are followers of Assaji
and Punabbasuka, speak thus: ‘The Lord, your reverences, has come together with
a large Order of monks … and with Sāriputta and Moggallāna; so, your
reverences, make ready lodgings for the Lord and for the Order of monks and for
Sāriputta and Moggallāna’.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Lord,” and these monks, having answered the Lord in assent, went up
to the monks who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka; having gone up to
the monks who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they spoke thus: “The
Lord, your reverences, has come … make ready lodgings for the Lord and for the
Order of monks and for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”</p>
<p>“There are no lodgings, your reverences, belonging to the Order; all were
distributed by us. The Lord, your reverences, is welcome, the Lord can stay in
whatever dwelling-place he likes. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are of depraved
desires, they are under the influence of depraved desires; we will not make
ready lodgings for them.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.16.2" href="#Kd.16.16.2"></a>
“But did you, your reverences, distribute lodgings belonging to the Order?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these monks who are followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka distribute
lodgings belonging to an Order?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.
He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks distributed … to an Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.”</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men distribute lodgings <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.241" href="#BD.5.241"></a>
belonging to an Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased …” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, these five things not to be divided up should not be divided up by an
Order or by a group or by an individual—even if divided up they are not
(really) divided up. Whoever should divide them up, there is a grave offence.
What are the five?</p>

Then the Lord, having stayed at Kiṭāgiri for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Āḷavī. Gradually, walking on tour, he arrived at Āḷavī. The
Lord stayed there at Āḷavī at the chief shrine of Āḷavī. Now at that time the
monks of Āḷavī gave repairs such as these into the charge (of a monk): they
gave repairs in charge when there was merely putting aside in heaps … when
there was merely smearing a wall … when there was merely placing a door … when
there was merely making a socket for a bolt … when there was merely making a
window-hole … when there was merely treating with whitewash … when there was
merely treating with black colouring … when there was merely treating with red
chalk … when there was merely roofing … when there was merely joining … when
there was merely putting on a bar (to a doorpost) … when there was merely
restoring broken and dilapidated parts … when there was merely plastering the
floors; and they gave repairs in charge for twenty years, and they gave repairs
in charge for thirty years, and they gave repairs in charge for life, and they
gave the repairs to a completed dwelling-place into the charge (of a monk
until) the time of his cremation.</p>

Those who were modest monks spread it about, saying: “How can the monks of
Āḷavī give repairs such as these into the charge (of a monk) … (until) the time

<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the monks of Āḷavī … the time of his

<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.17.2" href="#Kd.16.17.2"></a>
Now at that time monks gave the whole of a dwelling-place into charge for
repairs. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, the whole of a dwelling-place should not be given in charge for repairs.
Whoever should give one in charge, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.18.1" href="#Kd.16.18.1"></a>
Now at that time monks made use elsewhere of lodgings—appurtenances of a
dwelling-place—belonging to a lay-follower. Then that lay-follower … spread it
about, saying: “How can these revered sirs make use elsewhere of appurtenances
belonging somewhere else?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, you should not make use elsewhere of appurtenances belonging somewhere
else. Whoever should (so) make use of them, there is an offence of

<hr>
<p>Now at that time monks, being (too) scrupulous to convey to the Observance
house and to the meeting place (things to sit on), sat down on the ground.
Their limbs and robes were covered with dust. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to convey (things) temporarily.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time a great dwelling-place belonging to an Order fell into decay.
Monks, being scrupulous, did not take out the lodgings. They told this matter
to the Lord. He <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.245" href="#BD.5.245"></a>

Now at that time a costly woollen blanket—an accessory to a lodging—accrued to
an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to barter it for (something) advantageous.” Now at that
time a costly woven cloth … “to barter it for (something) advantageous.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time a bear’s hide accrued to an Order. They told this matter to
the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a towel for the feet.</span>” Drapery accrued. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a towel for the feet.</span>” Cloth accrued. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make a towel for the feet.</span>”</p>

Now at that time monks trod upon a lodging while their feet were unwashed; the
lodging was soiled. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, a lodging should not be trodden upon while your feet are unwashed.
Whoever should (so) tread upon one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>” Now at that time monks trod upon a lodging while their feet were damp …

Now at that time monks spat on ground that had been treated; the colour was
spoiled. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, you should not spit upon ground that has been treated. Whoever should
(so) spit, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a spittoon.</span>” Now at that time the legs of couches and the legs of chairs scratched ground

Now at that time monks leant against a wall that had been treated; the colour

lean against one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a reclining board.</span>” The reclining board scratched the ground underneath, it destroyed the wall
above. “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to wrap it round with a piece of cloth at the lower and the

<p>Now at that time monks were (too) scrupulous to lie down on a place for

Then the Lord, having stayed at Āḷavī for as long as he found suiting, set out
on tour for Rājagaha. Gradually, walking on tour, he arrived at Rājagaha. The
Lord stayed there at Rājagaha in the Great Grove at the squirrels’ feeding
place. Now at that time Rājagaha was short of food. People were not able to
make a meal for the Order (but) they wanted to make a meal for special (monks),
an invitation (-meal), food (allowed by) ticket, (food given) on a day of the
waxing or waning of the moon, (given) on an Observance day, (given) on the day
after an Observance day. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a meal for an Order, a meal for a special (monk), an
invitation (meal) … (food given) on the day after an Observance day.</span>”</p>
<h3>Agreement for an issuer of meals</h3>
<p>Now at that time the group of six monks, having chosen the sweet foods for
themselves, gave poor foods to (other) monks. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a monk possessed of

one who would not follow a wrong course from desire … from hatred … from
stupidity … from fear, and one who would know what is issued and what is not
issued.</span> And thus, monks, should he be agreed upon: First, a monk should be asked … ‘<span class="kamma">… Thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<p>Then it occurred to the monks who were issuers of meals: “Now, how should a
meal be issued?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to issue (the food) after having put it into heaps and
having tied on a ticket or a leaf.</span>”</p>
<h3>Agreement for an assigner of lodgings</h3>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.16.21.2" href="#Kd.16.21.2"></a>
Now at that time there was no assigner of lodgings for an Order. They told this

<hr>
<p>Now at that time there was no distributor of robe material … no distributor of
conjey … no distributor of fruit for an Order. They told this matter to the
Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks … and one who would know what <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.248" href="#BD.5.248"></a>
is distributed and what is not distributed</span> … ‘<span class="kamma">… Thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time there was no distributor of solid food for an Order. The solid
food, not being distributed, was lost. They told this matter to the Lord. He
said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you … and one who would know what is distributed and what is not
distributed</span> … ‘<span class="kamma">… Thus do I understand this</span>’.”</p>
<h3>Agreement on one to dispose of trifles</h3>

Now at that time trifling accessories had accrued in the storeroom of an Order.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a monk endowed with five qualities <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.177" href="#Vin.2.177"></a>

again.”</p>
<h3>Agreement on an accepter of outer cloaks</h3>
<p>Now at that time there was no accepter of outer cloaks … accepter of bowls for
an Order. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon … one who would know what is taken and what
is not taken.</span> And thus, monks, … ‘<span class="kamma">… Thus do I understand this.</span>.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time an Order had no superintendent of monastery attendants. The
monastery attendants, not being superintended, did not do the work (properly).
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to agree upon a superintendent of monastery attendants … <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.249" href="#BD.5.249"></a>
