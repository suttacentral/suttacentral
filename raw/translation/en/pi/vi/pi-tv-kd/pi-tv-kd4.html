<h2>Dwelling not in comfort</h2>

At one time the enlightened one, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time several monks, friends and
associates, entered on the rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country.
Then it occurred to these monks: “Now by what means can we, all together, on
friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go
short of almsfood?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.2" href="#Kd.4.1.2"></a>
Then it occurred to these monks: “If we should neither address one another nor
converse, but whoever should return first from the village for almsfood should
make ready a seat, should put out water for (washing) the feet, a footstool, a
footstand, having washed a refuse-bowl should set it out, should set out
drinking water and water for washing.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.3" href="#Kd.4.1.3"></a>
Whoever should return last from the village for almsfood, if there should be
the remains of a meal and if he should so desire, he may eat them; but if he
does not so desire, he may throw them away where there is but little green
grass or he may drop them into water where there are no living creatures, he
should put up the seat, he should put away the water for (washing) the feet,
the footstool, the footstand, he should put away the refuse-bowl having washed
it, he should put away the drinking water and the water for washing, he should
sweep the refectory.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.4" href="#Kd.4.1.4"></a>
Whoever should see a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or
a vessel (for water) for rinsing after evacuation, void and empty, should set
out (water); if it is impossible for him (to do this) he should set out (water)
by signalling with <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.209" href="#BD.4.209"></a>
his hand, having invited a companion (to help him) by a movement of his hand;
but he should not for such a reason break into speech. Thus may we, all
together, on friendly terms and harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season
and not go short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.5" href="#Kd.4.1.5"></a>
Then these monks neither addressed one another nor conversed. Whoever returned
first from the village for almsfood made ready a seat, put out water for
(washing) the feet, a foot-stool, a footstand, set out a refuse-bowl having
washed it, set out drinking water and water for washing. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.158" href="#Vin.1.158"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.6" href="#Kd.4.1.6"></a>
Whoever returned last from the village for almsfood, if there were the remains
of a meal ate them if he so desired; if he did not so desire he threw them away
where there was but little green grass or he dropped them into water where
there were no living creatures, he put up the seat, he put away the water for
(washing) the feet, the footstool, the footstand, he put away the refuse-bowl
having washed it, he put away the drinking water and the water for washing, he
swept the refectory.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.7" href="#Kd.4.1.7"></a>
Whoever saw a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a
vessel (for water) for rinsing after evacuation, void and empty, set out water.
If it was impossible for him (to do this) he set out water by signalling with
his hand, having by a movement of his hand invited a companion (to help him);
but not for such a reason did he break into speech.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.8" href="#Kd.4.1.8"></a>
Now it was the custom for monks who had kept the rains to go and see the Lord.
Then these monks, having kept the rains, at the end of the three months packed
away their lodgings and taking their bowls and robes, set out for Sāvatthī. In
due course they approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.210" href="#BD.4.210"></a>
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery and the Lord. Having approached, having greeted the
Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. Now it is the custom for awakened
ones, for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.9" href="#Kd.4.1.9"></a>
Then the Lord spoke thus to these monks: “I hope that you were well, monks, I
hope that you kept going, I hope that, all together, on friendly terms and
harmonious, you passed a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of
almsfood?”</p>
<p>“We were well, Lord, we kept going, Lord, and we, Lord, all together, on
friendly terms and harmonious, passed a comfortable rainy season and did not go
short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.10" href="#Kd.4.1.10"></a>
Now, Truthfinders (sometimes) ask knowing, and knowing (sometimes) do not ask;
they ask, knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the
right time (when not to ask). Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal,
not about what does not belong to the goal; there is bridge-breaking for
Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal. In two ways do awakened
ones, Lords question monks, either: “Shall we teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?” or “Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples?” Then the Lord spoke
thus to these monks:</p>
<p>“But in what way did you, monks, all together, on friendly terms and
harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.11" href="#Kd.4.1.11"></a>
“In that connection did we, Lord, several friends and associates, enter on the
rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country. Then it occurred to us,
Lord: ‘Now by what means can we, all together, on friendly terms and
harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.159" href="#Vin.1.159"></a>
not go short of almsfood?’ Then it occurred to us, Lord: ‘If we should neither
address one another … Thus could we, all together, on friendly terms and
harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood.’ So
we, Lord, neither addressed one another nor conversed. Whoever returned first
from the village for almsfood made ready a seat … but not for such a reason did
he break into speech. Thus did we, Lord, all together, on friendly terms and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.211" href="#BD.4.211"></a>
harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.12" href="#Kd.4.1.12"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Indeed, monks, these foolish men,
having spent an uncomfortable time, pretend to have spent an equally
comfortable time. Indeed, monks, these foolish men, having spent communion like
beasts, pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. Indeed … like sheep,
pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. Indeed … having spent
communion in indolence, pretend to have spent an equally comfortable time. How,
monks, can these foolish men observe an observance of members of (other) sects:
the practice of silence?</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.13" href="#Kd.4.1.13"></a>
“It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” Having
rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“
<span class="rule">Monks, an observance of members of other sects, the practice of silence, should
not be observed. Whoever should observe it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, monks who have kept the rains to ‘invite’ in regard to three
matters: what has been seen or heard or suspected.</span> That will be what is suitable for you in regard to one another, a removal of
offences, an aiming at (grasping) the discipline.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.1.14" href="#Kd.4.1.14"></a>
And thus, monks, should one invite. The Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Today is an Invitation day. If it
seems right to the Order, the Order may invite.</span>’ A monk who is an elder, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak
to it thus: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.212" href="#BD.4.212"></a>
‘<span class="kamma">Your reverences, I invite the Order in respect of what has been seen or heard
or suspected. Let the venerable ones speak to me out of compassion, and seeing
I will make amends. And a second time … And a third time, your reverences, I
invite the Order in respect of what has been seen or heard or suspected. Let
the venerable ones speak to me out of compassion, and seeing I will make
amends.</span>’ A newly ordained monk, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder …
having saluted with joined palms, should speak to it thus: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, I invite the Order <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.160" href="#Vin.1.160"></a>
in respect of what has been seen … And a second time … And a third time … and
seeing I will make amends.</span>’”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.2.1" href="#Kd.4.2.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks remained on seats while monks who were
elders, sitting down on their haunches, were themselves inviting. Those who
were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks
remain on seats while monks who are elders, sitting down on their haunches, are
themselves inviting?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks remained on seats …
were themselves inviting?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men remain on seats … are themselves inviting?
It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having
rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, you should not remain on seats while monks who are elders, sitting down
on their haunches, are themselves inviting. <span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to invite while each and every one is sitting down on his
haunches.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.2.2" href="#Kd.4.2.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain elder, feeble with age, thinking: “Until all have
invited”, while sitting down on his haunches and waiting, fell down in a faint.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, (each one) to sit down on his haunches during the period
until he invites, and having invited, to sit down on a seat.</span>”</p>
<h2>Division of the Invitation</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.1" href="#Kd.4.3.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.213" href="#BD.4.213"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many Invitation (days) are there?” They
told this to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these two Invitation (days),
the fourteenth and the fifteenth. These, monks, are the two Invitation
(days).”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.2" href="#Kd.4.3.2"></a>
Then it occurred to monks: “Now, how many (formal) acts for the Invitation are
there?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there are these
four (formal) acts for the Invitation: a (formal) act for the Invitation
(carried out) not by rule and when an assembly is incomplete… <span class="add">=
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd2#Kd.2.14.2">Kd.2.14.2</a>,

<em>read</em> act for the Invitation
<em>instead of</em> act for Observance</span> … you, monks, should train yourselves thus”.</p>
<h2>Allowance to give invitation</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.3" href="#Kd.4.3.3"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Gather together, monks, the Order
will invite.” When he had spoken thus a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:
“There is, Lord, a monk who is ill. He has not come.” He said: “I allow you,
monks, to give the Invitation on behalf of a monk who is ill. And thus, monks,
should it be given: That ill monk, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.161" href="#Vin.1.161"></a>
having approached one monk, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,
having sat down on his haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak
thus to him: ‘I will give the Invitation, convey the Invitation for me, invite
on my behalf.’ If he makes it understood by gesture, if he makes it understood
by voice, if he makes it understood by gesture and voice, the Invitation comes
to be given. If he does not make it understood by gesture … by gesture and
voice, the Invitation does not come to be given.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.4" href="#Kd.4.3.4"></a>
If he thus manages this, it is good. If he does not manage it then, monks, that
ill monk, having been brought to the midst of the Order on a couch or a chair,
should invite. If, monks, it occurs to the monks who are tending the ill one …
<span class="add">= <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd2#Kd.2.22.2">Kd.2.22.2</a></span> … the ill one should not be moved from (that) place; the Order having gone
there may invite, <span class="rule">but one should not invite if an Order is incomplete. Whoever should so invite,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.3.5" href="#Kd.4.3.5"></a>
“<span class="rule">If, monks, the conveyor of the Invitation goes away then and there … <span class="add">=

<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, on an Invitation day to give the consent also by giving the

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.4"></a>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.5.1" href="#Kd.4.5.1"></a>
Now at that time five monks were staying in a certain residence on an
Invitation day. Then it occurred to these monks: “It is laid down by the Lord
that an Order may invite, but we are (only) five persons. Now, how can we
invite?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to invite in an Order of five.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.5.2" href="#Kd.4.5.2"></a>
Now at that time four monks were staying in a certain residence on an
Invitation day. Then it occurred to these monks: “It is allowed by the Lord to

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.7.1" href="#Kd.4.7.1"></a>
Now at that time several resident monks, five or more, collected together in a
certain residence on an Invitation day. They did not know that the other
resident monks had not arrived. Thinking of the rule, thinking of discipline,
thinking that they were complete, they invited while they were incomplete.
While they were inviting, other resident monks, a larger number, arrived. They
told this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.7.2" href="#Kd.4.7.2"></a>

monk’s invitation on account of what was suspected, moreover I do not know on
account of what I am suspending this monk’s invitation’, and if, monks, the
reproving monk does not satisfy his intelligent fellows in the Brahma-faring

blameless. But if the reproving monk satisfies his intelligent fellows in the

monk is blameworthy.</p>

<h2>The story of makers of strife</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.17"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.1" href="#Kd.4.17.1"></a>
Now at that time several monks, friends and associates, entered on the rains in
a certain residence in the Kosala country. In their neighbourhood other monks,
makers of strife, makers of quarrels, makers of dispute, makers of contention,
makers of legal questions in an Order, entered on the rains, saying: “When
these monks have kept the rains we will suspend the invitation on an Invitation
day.” But those monks heard: “It is said that in our neighbourhood other monks
… entered on the rains, saying: ‘When these monks … on an Invitation day. ‘Now,
what line of conduct should be followed by us?” They told this matter to the
Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.2" href="#Kd.4.17.2"></a>
He said: “This is a case, monks, where several monks, friends and associates,
enter on the rains in a certain residence. In their neighbourhood … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd4#Kd.4.17.1">Kd.4.17.1</a></span> ‘… on an Invitation day’ I allow you, monks, to carry out two or three
Observances with these monks on the fourteenth (day), thinking: ‘How can we
invite before those monks (invite)?’ If, monks, those monks who are makers of
strife … makers of legal questions in an Order, arrive at a residence, then,
monks, those <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.231" href="#BD.4.231"></a>
resident monks, having gathered together quickly, may invite; and having
invited, they should say (to the others): ‘We, your reverences, have invited;
let the venerable ones do what seems fitting.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.3" href="#Kd.4.17.3"></a>
“If, monks, those monks who are makers of strife … makers of legal questions in
the Order, arrive unexpectedly at that residence, those resident monks should
make ready a seat, they should bring forward water for washing the feet, a
footstool, a footstand, having gone to meet them they should receive their
bowls and robes, they should offer them drinking water; having looked after
them, (then) having gone outside the boundary, they may invite; having invited,
they should say (to the others): ‘We, your reverences, have invited; let the
venerable ones do what seems fitting.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.4" href="#Kd.4.17.4"></a>
“If they should thus manage this, it is good. But if they do not manage it, the
resident monks should be informed by an experienced, competent resident monk,
saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Let the venerable ones who are residents listen to me. If it seems right to the
venerables ones, we may now carry out the Observance, we may recite the
Pātimokkha, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.176" href="#Vin.1.176"></a>
we may invite on the next new-moon day</span>’. If, monks, those monks who are makers of strife … makers of legal questions
in the Order, should speak thus to these monks: ‘All right, your reverences,
but let us invite now at once’, they should be spoken to thus: ‘But you, your
reverences, are not masters of our Invitation (-day), we will not invite yet’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.5" href="#Kd.4.17.5"></a>
“If, monks, these monks who are makers of strife … makers of legal questions in
the Order, should stay on until that new-moon day, then, monks, the resident
monks should be informed by an experienced, competent resident monk … ‘… <span class="kamma">let us invite on the next full-moon day</span>’ …

“If, monks, while these monks are themselves inviting, an
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.232" href="#BD.4.232"></a>
ill one suspends the invitation of one who is not ill, he should be spoken to
thus: ‘The venerable one is ill, and it is said by the Lord that one who is ill
is not able to endure being questioned. Wait, your reverence, until you are
well, when you are well you can reprove him if you desire to do so’. If being
spoken to thus, he (nevertheless) reproves him, in disrespect there is an
offence of expiation.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.8" href="#Kd.4.17.8"></a>
“If, monks, while these monks are themselves inviting, one who is not ill
suspends an ill one ‘s invitation, he should be spoken to thus: ‘Your
reverence, this monk is ill, and it is said by the Lord that one who is ill is
not able to endure being questioned. Wait, your reverence, until this monk is
well; when he is well you can reprove him if you desire to do so’. If being
spoken to thus, he (nevertheless) reproves him, in disrespect there is an
offence of expiation.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.9" href="#Kd.4.17.9"></a>
“If, monks, while these monks are themselves inviting, an ill one suspends an
ill one’s invitation, he should be spoken to thus: ‘The venerable ones are ill
… being questioned. Wait, your reverence, until you are (both) well; when he is
well you can reprove him if you desire to do so’. If, being spoken to thus, he
(nevertheless) reproves him, in disrespect there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.17.10" href="#Kd.4.17.10"></a>
“If, monks, while these monks are themselves inviting, one who is not ill
suspends the invitation of (another) who is not ill, the Order having
questioned both closely and cross-questioned them, having had them dealt with
according to the rule, may invite.”</p>
<h2>Harmonious invitation</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.4.18"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.18.1" href="#Kd.4.18.1"></a>
Now at that time several monks, friends and companions,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.177" href="#Vin.1.177"></a>
entered on the rains in a certain residence in the Kosala country. While these
were staying together on friendly terms and harmonious, a certain comfort was
arrived at. Then it occurred to these monks: “While we are staying together …
arrived at. But if we should invite now, it may be that (some) monks, having
invited, may set forth on tour, and so we will come to lose this comfort. Now
what line of conduct should be followed by us?” They told this matter to the
Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.18.2" href="#Kd.4.18.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.233" href="#BD.4.233"></a>
He said: “This is a case, monks, where several monks friends and companions,
enter on the rains in a certain residence. While these are staying together …
arrived at. If it then occurs to these monks: ‘While we are staying together so
we will come to lose this comfort’. I allow you, monks, to make a protection of
an Invitation day.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.18.3" href="#Kd.4.18.3"></a>
“And thus, monks, should it be made: Each and every one should gather together
in the same place; when they have gathered together, the Order should be
informed by an experienced competent monk, saying: ‘Honoured sirs, let the
Order listen to me. While we were staying together … so will we come to lose
this comfort. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may make a protection
of an Invitation day, it may carry out the Observance, it may recite the
Pātimokkha now; the Order may invite on the next <i lang="pi">komudī cātumāsinī</i> day. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.18.4" href="#Kd.4.18.4"></a>
“‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. While we were staying together …
so will we come to lose this comfort. The Order is making a protection of the
Invitation day; it will carry out the Observance, it will recite the Pātimokkha
now; it will invite on the next <i lang="pi">komudī cātumāsinī</i> day. If the making a protection of the Invitation day (by the Order) is
pleasing to the venerable ones (so that) it will carry out the Observance, will
recite the Pātimokkha now, and will invite on the next <i lang="pi">komudī cātumāsinī</i> day, you should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak. A
protection of the Invitation day is made by the Order, it will carry out the
Observance, it will recite the Pātimokkha now, and it will invite on the next <i lang="pi">komudī cātumāsinī</i> day. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand
this.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.18.5" href="#Kd.4.18.5"></a>
“If, monks, when these monks have made a protection of an Invitation day, any
monk should speak thus: ‘I want, your reverences, to set forth on a tour of the
country, I have business to do in the country’, he should be spoken to thus:
‘Very <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.234" href="#BD.4.234"></a>
well, your reverence, you can go when you have invited.’ And
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.178" href="#Vin.1.178"></a>
if, monks, that monk, while he is inviting, suspends another’s invitation, he
should be spoken to thus: ‘You, your reverence, are not master of my Invitation
day, I will not invite yet’. And if, monks, any monk suspends that monk’s
invitation while that monk is inviting, the Order, having questioned both
closely and cross-questioned them, should have them dealt with according to the
rule.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.4.18.6" href="#Kd.4.18.6"></a>
“If, monks, that monk, having concluded his business in the country, returns
again to that residence before the <i lang="pi">komudī cātumāsinī</i> day and if, monks, while those monks are inviting, any monk suspends that
monk’s invitation, he should be spoken to thus: ‘You, your reverence, are not
master of my Invitation day, I have invited (already)’. If, monks, while those
monks are inviting, that monk suspends any monk’s invitation, the Order, having
questioned both closely and having cross-questioned them, and having had them
dealt with according to the rule, may invite.”</p>
