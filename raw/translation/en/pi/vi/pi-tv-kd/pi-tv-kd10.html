<h1>10. The monks from Kosambī (<i lang="pi">Kosambaka</i>)</h1>
</div>
<h2>On the dispute among the monks from Kosambī</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.10"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.10.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.1" href="#Kd.10.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.483" href="#BD.4.483"></a>
At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s
monastery. Now at that time a certain monk had fallen into an offence; he saw
that offence as an offence but other monks saw that offence as no offence.
After a time he saw that offence as no offence, while the other monks saw that
offence as an offence. Then these monks spoke thus to that monk: “You, your
reverence, have fallen into an offence. Do you see this offence?”</p>
<p>“There is not an offence of mine, your reverences, that I can see.” Then these
monks, having obtained unanimity, suspended that monk for not seeing the
offence.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.2" href="#Kd.10.1.2"></a>
But that monk had heard much, he was one to whom the tradition had been handed
down; he was an expert on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, an expert on discipline, an expert on the summaries; he was wise,
experienced, clever; he was conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training.
Then that monk, having approached monks who were his comrades and intimates,
spoke thus: “This is no offence, your reverences, this is not an offence; I am
unfallen, I have not fallen; I am unsuspended, I am not suspended; I was
suspended by a (formal) act that was not legally valid, reversible, not fit to
stand. Let the venerable ones be my partisans on account of the rule, on
account of discipline.” And that monk gained as partisans the monks who were
his comrades and intimates. And he sent a messenger to monks in the country who
were his comrades and intimates, saying: “This is no offence, your reverences …
not fit to stand. Let the venerable ones be my partisans on account of the
rule, on account of discipline.” And that monk gained as partisans those monks
in the country who were his comrades and intimates.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.3" href="#Kd.10.1.3"></a>
Then these monks who took the part of the suspended one approached those monks
who had suspended him; having <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.484" href="#BD.4.484"></a>
approached, they spoke thus to the monks who had suspended him: “This is no
offence, your reverences, this is not an offence; this monk is unfallen, this
monk has not fallen; this monk is unsuspended, this monk <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.338" href="#Vin.1.338"></a>
is not suspended; he was suspended by a (formal) act that was not legally
valid, reversible, not fit to stand.” When they had spoken thus, the monks who
had suspended him spoke thus to the monks who took the part of the suspended
one:</p>
<p>“This is an offence, your reverences, this is not no offence; this monk has
fallen, this monk is not unfallen; this monk is suspended, this monk is not
unsuspended; he was suspended by a (formal) act that was legally valid,
irreversible, fit to stand. Do not you, your reverences, take the part of this
suspended monk, do not side with him.” But those monks who took the part of the
suspended (monk), although being spoken to thus by the ones who had suspended
him, still took the part of that suspended monk and sided with him.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.4" href="#Kd.10.1.4"></a>
Then a certain monk approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the
Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, that monk spoke thus to the Lord: “This is a case, Lord,
where a certain monk has fallen into an offence. He saw that offence as an
offence but other monks saw that offence as no offence. After a time he saw
that offence as no offence, while the other monks saw that offence as an
offence. Then, Lord, those monks spoke thus to that monk: … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.1.1">Kd.10.1.1</a></span> ‘… Do you see this offence?’ He said: ‘There is not an offence of mine, your
reverences, that I can see Then, Lord, these monks, having obtained unanimity,
suspended that monk for not seeing the offence. But, Lord, that monk had heard
much, he was one to whom the tradition had been handed down … desirous of
training. Then, Lord, that monk, having approached monks who were his comrades
and intimates … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.1.2">Kd.10.1.2</a></span> … And, Lord, that monk gained as partisans the monks who were his comrades and
intimates … And, Lord, that monk gained as partisans those monks in the country
who were his comrades and intimates. Then, Lord, those monks who took the part
of the suspended one … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.1.3">Kd.10.1.3</a></span> … When they had spoken thus, Lord, the monks who had suspended him spoke thus:
… But those monks, Lord, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.485" href="#BD.4.485"></a>
who took the part of the suspended (monk) although being spoken to thus by the
ones who had suspended him, still took the part of that suspended monk and
sided with him.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.5" href="#Kd.10.1.5"></a>
Then the Lord, thinking: “The Order of monks is divided, the Order of monks is
divided”, rising from-his seat approached the monks who had suspended (that
monk); having approached, he sat down on the appointed seat. As he was sitting
down, the Lord spoke thus to the monks who had suspended (that monk): “Do not
you, monks, thinking: ‘It appears so to us, it appears so to us deem that a
monk should be suspended on every occasion.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.6" href="#Kd.10.1.6"></a>
“This is a case, monks, where a monk has fallen into an offence. He sees that
offence as no offence; other monks see that offence as an offence. If, monks,
those monks know concerning that monk: ‘This venerable one has heard much, he
is one to whom the tradition has been handed down … desirous of training. If we
suspend this monk for not seeing the offence <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.339" href="#Vin.1.339"></a>
we cannot carry out the Observance together with this monk, we will carry out
the Observance without this monk—from this source there will be strife,
dispute, contention, brawls, for the Order, there will be schism in the Order,
dissension in the Order, altercation in the Order, differences in the Order.’
Monks, that monk should not be suspended for not seeing an offence by monks
bent on a schism.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.7" href="#Kd.10.1.7"></a>
“This is a case, monks, where a monk has fallen into an offence. He sees that
offence … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.1.6">Kd.10.1.6</a></span> ‘… if we suspend this monk for not seeing the offence we cannot invite
together with this monk, we will invite without this monk; we cannot carry out
a (formal) act of the Order together with this monk, we will carry out a
(formal) act of the Order without this monk; we cannot sit down on a seat
together with this monk, we will sit down on a seat without this monk; we
cannot sit down to drink conjey together with this monk, we will sit down to
drink conjey without this monk; we cannot sit down in a refectory together with
this monk, we will sit down in a refectory without this monk; we cannot stay
under one roof together with this monk, we will stay under one roof <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.486" href="#BD.4.486"></a>
without this monk; we cannot, according to seniority, carry out greeting
together with this monk, rising up before (one another), saluting with joined
palms, doing the proper duties, but we will, according to seniority, carry out
greetings … doing the proper duties without this monk—from this source there
will be strife … differences in the Order.’ Monks, that monk should not be
suspended for not seeing an offence by monks bent on a schism.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.8" href="#Kd.10.1.8"></a>
Then the Lord, having spoken on this matter with the monks who had suspended
that monk, rising from his seat, approached those monks who were taking the
part of the suspended (monk); having approached, he sat down on the appointed
seat. As he was sitting down, the Lord spoke thus to the monks who were taking
the part of the suspended (monk): “Do not you, monks, having fallen into an
offence, deem that amends should not be made for the offence, thinking: ‘We
have not fallen’. This is a case, monks, where a monk has fallen into an
offence; he sees that offence as no offence; other monks see that offence as an
offence. If, monks, that monk knows concerning those monks: ‘These venerable
ones have heard much … <span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.1.2">Kd.10.1.2</a></span> … desirous of training. It is impossible for them, because of me or because of
anyone else, to follow a wrong course through desire, through hatred, through
stupidity, through fear. If these monks suspend me for not seeing the offence,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.340" href="#Vin.1.340"></a>
if they do not carry out the Observance together with me, if they carry out the
Observance without me … if they do not invite together with me, if they invite
without me … if they, according to seniority, carry out greetings without me,
rising up before (one another), saluting with joined palms, doing the proper
duties—from this source there will be for the Order strife … differences in the
Order’. Monks, the offence should be confessed even out of faith in others by a
monk who is bent on a schism.” Then the Lord, having spoken on this matter with
the monks who took the part of the suspended (monk), rising from his seat,
departed.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.9" href="#Kd.10.1.9"></a>
Now at that time monks taking the part of a suspended
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.487" href="#BD.4.487"></a>
(monk) carried out the Observance just there within the boundary, and carried
out a (formal) act of the Order; but the monks who had suspended (him), having
gone outside the boundary, carried out the Observance and carried out a
(formal) act of the Order (there). Then ascertain monk who had suspended him,
approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at
a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, that
monk spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, these monks who are taking the part of a
suspended (monk) are carrying out the Observance just there within the
boundary, they are carrying out a (formal) act of the Order; but we, the monks
who have suspended him, having gone outside the boundary, are carrying out the
Observance, we are carrying out a (formal) act of the Order (there).”</p>
<p>“Monk, if these monks who are taking the part of the suspended (monk) are
carrying out the Observance just there within the boundary and are carrying out
a (formal) act of the Order, these (formal) acts of theirs will be legally
valid, irreversible, fit to stand because a motion and a proclamation have been
laid down by me. If, monk, you monks who suspended him, carry out the
Observance just there within the boundary, if you carry out a (formal) act of
the Order, these (formal) acts of yours are also legally valid, irreversible,
fit to stand, because a motion and a proclamation have been laid down by me.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.1.10" href="#Kd.10.1.10"></a>
“What is the reason for this? These monks belong to a different communion from
yours and you belong to a different communion from theirs. Monk, there are
these two grounds for belonging to a different communion: either, of oneself
one makes oneself belong to a different communion, or a complete Order suspends
one for not seeing or for not making amends for or for not giving up. Monk,
there are these two grounds for belonging to a different communion. Monk, there
are these two grounds for belonging to the same communion: either, of oneself
one makes oneself belong to the same communion, or a complete Order restores
one who was suspended for not seeing or for not making amends for or for not
giving up. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.488" href="#BD.4.488"></a>
Monk, there are these two grounds for belonging to the same communion.”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.341" href="#Vin.1.341"></a></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.10.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.1" href="#Kd.10.2.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, causing quarrels, causing strife, falling into disputes
in a refectory amidst the houses, behaved unsuitably towards one another in
gesture, in speech; they came to blows. People looked down upon, criticised,
spread it about, saying: “How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, causing
quarrels … come to blows?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about.
Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can these monks …
come to blows?” Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Is it
true, as is said, monks, that monks … came to blows?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he
addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks, if an Order is divided, if it is behaving not according to the rule, if
there is unfriendliness, you should sit down on a seat thinking: ‘At least we
will not behave unsuitably to one another in gesture, in speech; we will not
come to blows.’ Monks, if an Order is divided but if it is behaving according
to the rule, if there is friendliness, you may sit down on a seat next (to one
another).”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.2" href="#Kd.10.2.2"></a>
Now at that time monks, making quarrels, making strife, falling into disputes
in the midst of an Order, wounded one another with the weapons of the tongue;
they were not able to settle that legal question. Then a certain monk
approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he stood at a
respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, that monk
spoke thus to the Lord: “This is a case, Lord, where monks, making quarrels …
are not able to settle that legal question. It would be good, Lord, if the Lord
out of compassion were to approach those monks.” The Lord consented by becoming
silent. The Lord approached those monks; having approached he sat down on the
appointed <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.489" href="#BD.4.489"></a>
seat. As he was sitting down, the Lord spoke thus to those monks:</p>
<p>“Enough, monks; no strife, no quarrels, no contention, no disputing.” When he
had spoken thus, a certain monk who spoke what was not- <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord let the Lord, the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-master wait; Lord, let the Lord, unconcerned, live intent on abiding in ease
here and now; <em>we</em> will be (held) accountable for this strife, quarrel, contention, disputing.”
And a second time the Lord spoke thus to these monks: “Enough, monks; no strife
… no disputing.” And a second time the monks who spoke what was not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> spoke thus to the Lord:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.342" href="#Vin.1.342"></a>
“Lord, let the Lord, the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-master wait; …
<em>we</em> will be (held) accountable for this … disputing.”</p>
<h2>The story of Dīghāvu</h2>
<div class="jataka">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.3" href="#Kd.10.2.3"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Once upon a time, monks, at Benares
Brahmādatta was king of Kāsi; he was rich, wealthy, opulent, of great strength,
with many vehicles; he had large territories, full storehouses and granaries.
Dīghīti was the name of the king of Kosala. He was poor, of little wealth, of
few means, of little strength, with few vehicles, he had (only) small
territories, storehouses and granaries that were not full. Then, monks,
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, having arrayed a fourfold army, marched against
Dīghīti, the King of Kosala. Then, monks, Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, heard:
‘They say that Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, having arrayed a fourfold army,
is marching against me.’ Then, monks, it occurred to Dīghīti, the King of
Kosala: ‘Now Brahmādatta, King of Kāsi, is rich, wealthy, opulent … full
storehouses and granaries. I am not competent to stand against even one attack
of Brahmādatta, King of Kāsi. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.490" href="#BD.4.490"></a>
Suppose I were to flee from the town beforehand? ‘Then, monks, Dīghīti, the
King of Kosala, taking his chief consort, fled from the town beforehand. Then,
monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, conquering the troops and vehicles and
territory and storehouses and granaries of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, lived
as the master. Then, monks, Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, set out for Benares
with his wife. In due course he arrived at Benares. Monks, Dīghīti, the King of
Kosala, dwelt there with his wife in a certain place adjoining Benares in a
potter’s house, in disguise, clothed as a wanderer.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.4" href="#Kd.10.2.4"></a>
“Then soon, monks, the chief consort of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, became
pregnant. She had a fancy of this kind: she wanted, at sunrise, to see a
fourfold army arrayed, armoured, standing on level ground and to drink at the
washing of the swords. Then, monks, the chief consort of Dīghīti, the King of
Kosala, spoke thus to Dīghīti, the King of Kosala: ‘Sire, I am pregnant; a
fancy of this kind has risen in me: I want, at sunrise, to see a fourfold army
… and to drink at the washing of the swords.’ He said: ‘Lady, whence is there
for us who are in distress a fourfold army arrayed, armoured, standing on level
ground and a washing of the swords? ‘She said: ‘If I, sire, do not get a chance
(to have my wish) I shall die.’</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.5" href="#Kd.10.2.5"></a>
“Now at that time, monks, the Brahmin priest of Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi,
was a friend of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.343" href="#Vin.1.343"></a>
Then, monks, Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, approached the Brahmin priest of
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi; having approached, he spoke thus to the Brahmin
priest <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.491" href="#BD.4.491"></a>
of Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi: ‘A lady friend of yours, old dear, is
pregnant; a fancy of this kind has risen in her: she wants, at sunrise to see a
fourfold army … and to drink at the washing of the swords.’ He said: ‘Well
then, sire, let us see the queen too.’ Then, monks, the chief consort of
Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, approached the Brahmin priest of Brahmādatta, the
King of Kāsi. Then, monks, that Brahmin priest of Brahmādatta, the King of
Kāsi, saw the chief consort of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, coming in the
distance, and seeing her, rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe
over one shoulder, having with joined palms saluted the chief consort of
Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, he three times uttered this utterance: ‘Indeed, a
king of Kosala is in your womb, indeed, a king of Kosala is in your womb.’ And
he said: ‘Do not be distressed, queen, you will get the chance at the time of
sunrise to see a fourfold army arrayed, armoured, standing on level ground and
to drink at the washing of the swords.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.6" href="#Kd.10.2.6"></a>
“Then, monks, the brahmin priest of Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, approached
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi; having approached, he spoke thus to Brahmādatta,
the King of Kāsi: ‘Sire, the signs that are visible are such that tomorrow at
the time of sunrise a fourfold army arrayed, armoured, must stand on level
ground and the swords must be washed.’ Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of
Kāsi, enjoined people, saying: ‘Good sirs, do as the Brahmin priest says.’ So,
monks, the chief consort of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, got the chance at the
time of sunrise of seeing a fourfold army arrayed, armoured, standing on level
ground, and of drinking at the washing of the swords. Then, monks, the chief
consort of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, when the child in her womb had reached
maturity, gave birth to a son. They gave him the name of Dīghāvu. Then, monks,
soon afterwards Prince Dīghāvu attained years of discretion.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.7" href="#Kd.10.2.7"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.492" href="#BD.4.492"></a>
“Then, monks, it occurred to Dīghīti, the King of Kosala: ‘This Brahmādatta,
King of Kāsi, has done us much mischief; our troops and vehicles and
territories and storehouses and granaries have been stolen by him. If he knew
about us he would have all three of us put to death. Suppose I should make
Prince Dīghāvu live outside the town?’ Then, monks, Dīghāti, the King of
Kosala, made Prince Dīghāvu live outside the town. Then, monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.344" href="#Vin.1.344"></a>
Prince Dīghāvu, while living outside the town, soon learnt every craft.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.8" href="#Kd.10.2.8"></a>
“Now at that time, monks, the barber of Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, dwelt at
(the court of) Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi. The barber of Dīghāti, the King
of Kosala, saw Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, with his wife in a certain place
adjoining Benares, dwelling in a potter’s house, in disguise, clothed as a
wanderer; seeing him, he approached Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi; having
approached, he spoke thus to Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi: ‘Sire, Dīghāti, the
King of Kosala, is dwelling with his wife … clothed as a wanderer’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.9" href="#Kd.10.2.9"></a>
“Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, enjoined the people, saying: ‘Well
then, good sirs, bring along Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, with his wife.’ And,
monks, these people having answered, ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to Brahmādatta, the
King of Kāsi, brought along Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, with his wife. Then,
monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, enjoined the people, saying: “Well now,
good sirs, having bound Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, and his wife with stout
cord, their arms pinioned tightly behind their backs, having shaved them bald,
having paraded them to a harsh-sounding kettle-drum from street to street, from
cross-road to cross-road, having ejected them by the southern gate of the town,
having at the south of the town chopped them into four pieces, discard the
pieces to the four quarters.” And these people, monks, having answered, ‘Yes,
sire’, in assent to Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, having bound Dīghāti, the
King of Kosala, and his wife with stout cord, their arms pinioned tightly
behind their backs, having shaved them bald, paraded them with a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.493" href="#BD.4.493"></a>
harsh-sounding kettle-drum from street to street and from cross-road to
cross-road.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.10" href="#Kd.10.2.10"></a>
“Then, monks, it occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘It is a long time since I have
seen my parents. Suppose now I should see my parents?’ Then, monks, Prince
Dīghāvu, having entered Benares, saw his parents bound with stout cord their
arms pinioned tightly behind their backs, shaved bald, parading to a
harsh-sounding kettle-drum from street to street, from cross-road to
cross-road; and seeing them he approached his parents. Then, monks, Dīghāti,
the King of Kosala, saw Prince Dīghāvu coming from afar, and seeing him he
spoke thus to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘Do not you, dear Dīghāvu, look far or close for,
dear Dīghāvu, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.345" href="#Vin.1.345"></a>
wrathful moods are not allayed by wrath: wrathful moods, dear Dīghāvu, are
allayed by non-wrath.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.11" href="#Kd.10.2.11"></a>
“When he had spoken thus, monks, these people spoke thus to Dīghāti, the King
of Kosala: ‘This Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, is mad, he is talking gibberish.
Who is Dīghāvu to him that he should speak thus: “Do not you … by non-wrath”?’
He said: ‘I am not mad, good sirs, I am not talking gibberish; what is more,
whoever is learned will understand.’ And a second time, monks, … And a third
time, monks, did Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, speak thus to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘Do
not you, dear Dīghāvu, look far or close … by non-wrath.’ And a third time,
monks, did these people speak thus to Dīghāti, the King of Kosala: ‘This
Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, is mad …’ And a third time, monks, did Dīghāti,
the King of Kosala, speak thus to these people: ‘I am not mad … whoever is
learned will understand.’ Then, monks, these people having paraded Dīghāti, the
King of Kosala, and his wife from street to street, from cross-road to
cross-road, having ejected them by the southern gate, having chopped them into
four pieces at the south of the town, having discarded the pieces to the four
quarters, and having stationed troops (there), departed.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.12" href="#Kd.10.2.12"></a>
“Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu, having entered Benares, having brought back
strong drink, made the troops drink it. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.494" href="#BD.4.494"></a>
When these had fallen down, intoxicated, then (Dīghāvu) having collected
sticks, having made a funeral pyre, having put his parents’ bodies on to the
funeral pyre, having lit it, three times circumambulated the funeral pyre, his
palms joined. Now at that time Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, was on an upper
terrace of his palace. He saw Prince Dīghāvu, monks, three times
circumambulating the funeral pyre, his palms joined, and seeing him it occurred
to him: ‘Undoubtedly this man is a relation or a kinsman of Dīghīti, the King
of Kosala. Alas, this spells misfortune for me, for no one will tell me what it

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.13" href="#Kd.10.2.13"></a>
“Then, monks. Prince Dīghāvu, having gone to a jungle, having cried and wept,
having dried his tears, having entered Benares, having gone to an elephant
stable near the king’s palace, spoke thus to the elephant trainer: ‘I want to
learn the craft, teacher.’ He said: ‘Well then, my good youngster, learn it.’
Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu, rising in the night towards dawn, sang in a sweet
voice in the elephant stable and played the lute. And monks, Brahmādatta, the
King of Kāsi, rising in the night towards dawn heard the singing in the sweet
voice and the lute-playing in the elephant stable; having heard, he asked the
people: ‘Who, good sirs <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.346" href="#Vin.1.346"></a>
, rising in the night towards dawn, was singing in a sweet voice and playing a
lute in the elephant stable?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.14" href="#Kd.10.2.14"></a>
“‘Sire, a youngster, a pupil of such and such an elephant trainer, rising in
the night towards dawn, was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the
elephant stable.’ He said: ‘Well then, good sirs, bring that youngster along.’
And, monks, these people, having answered, ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, brought along Prince Dīghāvu. (The king said:)
“Did you, my good youngster, rising … sing in a sweet voice and play a lute in
the elephant stable?’ ‘Yes, sire,’ he said. ‘Well, then, do you, my good
youngster, sing and play the lute (before me).’ And, monks, Prince Dīghāvu,
having answered, ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi,
longing for success, sang in <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.495" href="#BD.4.495"></a>
a sweet voice and played the lute. Then, monks, Brahmādatta the King of Kāsi,
spoke thus to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘Do you, my good youngster, attend on me.’ Then,
monks, Prince Dīghāvu answered ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to Brahmādatta, the King
of Kāsi. Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu became an earlier riser than Brahmādatta,
the King of Kāsi, he lay down later, he was a willing servant, eager to please,
speaking affectionately. Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, soon
established Prince Dīghāvu in a confidential position of trust.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.15" href="#Kd.10.2.15"></a>
“Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, spoke thus to Prince Dīghāvu:
‘Well now, good youngster, harness a chariot, I will go out hunting.’ And,
monks, Prince Dīghāvu having answered, ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to Brahmādatta,
the King of Kāsi, having harnessed a chariot, spoke thus to Brahmādatta, the
King of Kāsi: ‘A chariot is harnessed for you, sire; for this you may think it
is now the right time.’ Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, mounted the
chariot, Prince Dīghāvu drove the chariot, and he drove the chariot in such a
manner that the army went by one way and the chariot by another. Then, monks,
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, having gone far, spoke thus to Prince Dīghāvu:
‘Well now, good youngster, unharness the chariot; as I am tired I will lie
down.’ And, monks, Prince Dīghāvu having answered ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, having unharnessed the chariot, sat down
cross-legged on the ground. Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, lay
down having laid his head on Prince Dīghāvu’s lap, and because he was tired he
fell asleep at once.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.16" href="#Kd.10.2.16"></a>
“Then, monks, it occurred to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘This Brahmādatta, King of Kāsi,
has done us much <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.347" href="#Vin.1.347"></a>
mischief, he has stolen our troops and vehicles and territory and store-houses,
and granaries, and he has killed my parents. This could be a time when I could
show my wrath,’ and he drew his sword from its sheath. Then, monks, it occurred
to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘My father spoke to me thus at the time of his dying: ‘Do
not you, dear Dīghāvu, look far or close, for, dear Dīghāvu, wrathful moods are
not allayed by wrath: wrathful moods, dear Dīghāvu, are allayed by non-wrath.”
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.496" href="#BD.4.496"></a>
It would not be suitable for me to transgress my father’s words,’ and he
replaced his sword in its sheath. And a second time, monks, it occurred to
Prince Dīghāvu: ‘This Brahmādatta … when I could show my wrath,’ and he drew
his sword from its sheath. And a second time, monks, it occurred to Prince
Dīghāvu: ‘My father spoke to me thus … It would not be suitable for me to
transgress my father’s words,’ and again he replaced his sword in its sheath.
And a third time … and again he replaced his sword in its sheath. Then, monks,
Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, frightened, agitated, fearful, alarmed, suddenly
got up. Then, monks. Prince Dīghāvu spoke thus to Brahmādatta, the King of
Kāsi: ‘Why do you, sire, frightened … suddenly get up? ‘He said: ‘As I was
dreaming here, my good youngster, the son of Dīghīti, the King of Kosala,
attacked me with a sword. That is why I, frightened … suddenly got up.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.17" href="#Kd.10.2.17"></a>
“Then, monks, Prince Dīghāvu, having stroked the head of Brahmādatta, the King
of Kāsi, with his left hand, having drawn his sword with his right hand, spoke
thus to Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi: ‘I, sire, am Prince Dīghāvu, that son of
Dīghīti, the King of Kosala. You have done us much mischief, our troops,
vehicles, territory, storehouses and granaries were stolen by you, and my
parents were killed by you. This could be a time when I could show my wrath.’
Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, inclining his head towards Prince
Dīghāvu’s feet, spoke thus to Prince Dīghāvu: ‘Grant me my life, dear Dīghāvu,
grant me my life, dear Dīghāvu.’</p>
<p>“‘How am I able to grant life to a king? It is a king who should grant me
life.’</p>
<p>“‘Well then, dear Dīghāvu, you grant me life and I will grant you life.’ Then,
monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, and Prince Dīghāvu granted life to one
another and they took hold of (one another’s) hands and they made an oath to do
(one another) no harm. Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, spoke thus
to Prince Dīghāvu: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.348" href="#Vin.1.348"></a>
‘Well then, dear Dīghāvu, harness the chariot; we will go away.’ And, monks,
Prince Dīghāvu, having answered, ‘Yes, sire’, in assent to Brahmādatta, the
King of Kāsi, having harnessed the chariot, spoke thus to Brahmādatta, the King
of Kāsi: ‘The <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.497" href="#BD.4.497"></a>
chariot is harnessed for you, sire; for this you may think it is now the right
time.’ Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, mounted the chariot. Prince
Dīghāvu drove the chariot, and he drove the chariot in such a manner that soon
it met the army.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.18" href="#Kd.10.2.18"></a>
“Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, having entered Benares, having had
the ministers and councillors convened, spoke thus: ‘If, good sirs, you should
see Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghāti, the King of Kosala, what would you do
to him? ‘Some spoke thus: ‘We, sire, would cut off his hands; we, sire, would
cut off his feet; we, sire, would cut off his hands and feet; … his ears, … his
nose, … his ears and nose, … we, sire, would cut off his head.’ He said: ‘This,
good sirs, is Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghāti, the King of Kosala; there is
no occasion to do anything (against him); life was granted by him to me and
life was granted by me to him.’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.19" href="#Kd.10.2.19"></a>
“Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, spoke thus to Prince Dīghāvu:
‘Concerning that, dear Dīghāvu, which your father said to you at the time of
dying: “Do not you, dear Dīghāvu, look far or close, for, dear Dīghāvu,
wrathful moods are not allayed by wrath: wrathful moods, dear Dīghāvu, are
allayed by non-wrath”—what did your father mean?’ He said: ‘Concerning that,
sire, which my father said to me at the time of dying—“not far” means: do not
bear wrath long. This is what my father said to me, sire, at the time of dying
when he said “not far”. Concerning that, sire, which my father said to me at
the time of dying—“not close” means: do not hastily break with a friend. This
is what my father said to me, sire, at the time of dying when he said “not
close”. Concerning that, sire, which my father said to me at the time of
dying—“for, dear Dīghāvu, wrathful moods are not allayed by wrath: wrathful
moods, dear Dīghāvu, are allayed by non-wrath” means: my parents were killed by
a king, but if I were to deprive the king of life those who desired the king’s
welfare would deprive me of life and those who desired my welfare would deprive
these of life; thus that wrath would not be settled by wrath. But now <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.498" href="#BD.4.498"></a>
that life is granted me by a king and life is granted a king by me, thus is
wrath settled by non-wrath. This is what my father said to me, sire, at the
time of dying when he said: ‘for, dear Dīghāvu, wrathful moods are not allayed
by wrath; wrathful moods, dear Dīghāvu, are allayed by non-wrath’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.2.20" href="#Kd.10.2.20"></a>
“Then, monks, Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, thinking:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.349" href="#Vin.1.349"></a>
‘Indeed, it is marvellous, indeed, it is wonderful that this Prince Dīghāvu is
so clever that he understands in full the matter which was spoken by his father
in brief’, gave back his father’s troops and vehicles and territory and
storehouses and granaries, and he gave him his daughter.</p>

<p>“Now, monks, if such is the forbearance and gentleness of kings who wield the
sceptre, who wield the sword, herein, monks, let your light shine forth so that
you who have gone forth in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline which are thus well taught may be equally forbearing and
gentle.” And a third time the Lord spoke thus to these monks: “Enough, monks;
no strife, no quarrels, no contention, no disputing.” And a third time that
monk who spoke what was not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, let the Lord, the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-master, wait; Lord, let the Lord, unconcerned, live intent on abiding in ease
here and now; <em>we</em> will be (held) accountable for this strife, quarrel, contention, disputing.”
Then the Lord, thinking: “These foolish men are as though infatuate; it is not

Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered
Kosambī for almsfood; having walked for almsfood in Kosambī, bringing back his
almsbowl after his meal, having packed away his lodging, taking his bowl and

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.10.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.1" href="#Kd.10.4.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having spoken these verses as he was standing in the midst of
the Order, approached Bālakaloṇakāra village. Now at that time the venerable
Bhagu was staying in Bālakaloṇakāra village. Then the venerable Bhagu saw the
Lord coming from afar; seeing him, he made ready a seat, set out water for the
feet, a footstool, a foot-stand, and having gone to meet him, he received his
bowl and robe. Then the Lord sat down on the seat made ready; as he was sitting
down he had his feet bathed. And the venerable Bhagu, having greeted the Lord,
sat down at a respectful distance. As the venerable Bhagu was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the Lord spoke thus to him: “I hope, monk, things are
going well, I hope you are keeping going, I hope you are not short of
almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Things are going well, Lord, I am keeping going, Lord, and, Lord, I am not
short of almsfood.” Then the Lord, having delighted, rejoiced, roused,
gladdened the venerable Bhagu with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, departed for the Eastern Bamboo Grove.</p>
<h2>On going to Pācīnavaṁsadāya</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.2" href="#Kd.10.4.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.501" href="#BD.4.501"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Anuruddha and the venerable Nandiya and the
venerable Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove. The keeper of the
Grove saw the Lord coming from afar; seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: “Do
not, recluse, enter this Grove; there are three young men of respectable
families staying here desiring self; do not cause them discomfort.” The
venerable Anuruddha heard the keeper of the Grove conferring with the Lord;
having heard, he spoke thus to the keeper of the Grove: “Do not, good
grove-keeper, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.351" href="#Vin.1.351"></a>
impede the Lord. It is our teacher, the Lord, who is arriving.” Then the
venerable Anuruddha approached the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila;
having approached, he spoke thus to the venerable Nandiya and to the venerable
Kimbila:” Go forward, venerable ones, go forward, venerable ones; our teacher,
the Lord is arriving.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.3" href="#Kd.10.4.3"></a>
Then the venerable Anuruddha and the venerable Nandiya and the venerable
Kimbila, having gone out to meet the Lord, one received his bowl and robe, one
made ready a seat, one set out water for the feet, a footstool, a foot-stand.
Then the Lord sat down on the seat made ready; as he was sitting down he had
his feet bathed. Then these venerable ones, having greeted the Lord, sat down
at a respectful distance. As the venerable Anuruddha was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the Lord spoke thus: “I hope that things are going well
with you, Anuruddhas, I hope you are keeping going, I hope you are not short of
almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Things are going well, Lord, we are keeping going, Lord, and, Lord, we are not
short of almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.502" href="#BD.4.502"></a>
“I hope that you, Anuruddhas, are living all together on friendly terms and
harmonious, as milk and water blend, regarding one another with the eye of
affection?”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly, Lord, we are living all together on friendly terms and
harmonious, as milk and water blend, regarding one another with the eye of
affection.”</p>
<p>“And how is it that you, Anuruddhas, are living … of affection?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.4" href="#Kd.10.4.4"></a>
“As to this, Lord, it occurred to me: ‘Indeed it is a gain for me, indeed it is
well gotten by me, that I am living with such Brahma-farers.’ On account of
this, Lord, for these venerable ones amity as to bodily conduct, whether openly
or in private, has risen up in me, amity as to speech, amity as to thought,
whether openly or in private, has risen up. Because of this. Lord, it occurred
to me: ‘What now, if I, having surrendered my own mind, should live only
according to the mind of these venerable ones?’ So I, Lord, having surrendered
my own mind, am living only according to the mind of these venerable ones.
Lord, we have divers bodies, but assuredly only one mind.”</p>
<p>And the venerable Nandiya too, and also the venerable Kimbila spoke thus to the
Lord: “And it occurred to me too, Lord: ‘Indeed it is a gain for me … only one
mind’. It is thus, Lord, that we are living all together on friendly terms and
harmonious, as milk and water blend, regarding one another with the eye of
affection.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.5" href="#Kd.10.4.5"></a>
“And I hope that you, Anuruddhas,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.352" href="#Vin.1.352"></a>
are living zealous, ardent, self-resolute?”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly, Lord, we are living … self-resolute.”</p>
<p>“And how is it that you, Anuruddhas, are living … self-resolute?”</p>
<p>“As to this, Lord, whichever of us returns first from the village for almsfood,
he makes ready a seat, puts out water for washing the feet, a footstool, a
foot-stand; having washed a refuse-bowl he sets it out, he sets out water for
drinking <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.503" href="#BD.4.503"></a>
and water for washing. Whoever returns last from the village for almsfood, if
there are the remains of a meal and if he so desires, he eats them; if he does
not desire to do so he throws them out where there are no crops or drops them
into water where there are no living creatures; he puts up the seat, he puts
away the water for the feet, the footstool, the foot-stand, having washed the
refuse-bowl, he puts it away, he puts away the water for drinking and the water
for washing, he sweeps the refectory. Whoever sees a vessel for drinking water
or a vessel for washing water or a vessel (for water) for rinsing after an
evacuation, void and empty, he sets out (water). If it is impossible for him
(to do this) by a movement of his hand, having invited a companion to help us
by signalling (to him) with the hand, we set out (water); but we do not, Lord,
for such a reason break into speech. And then we, Lord, once in every five
nights sit down together for talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. It is thus, Lord, that we are living, zealous, ardent, self-resolute.”</p>
<h2>On going to Pārileyyaka</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.6" href="#Kd.10.4.6"></a>
Then the Lord, having delighted, rejoiced, roused, gladdened the venerable
Anuruddha and the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat, set out on tour for Pārileyya. Walking on tour in due
course he arrived at Pārileyya. The Lord stayed there at Pārileyya in the
Guarded Woodland Thicket at the root of the lovely <i lang="pi">sāl</i>-tree. Then as the Lord was meditating in private a reasoning arose in his mind
thus: “Formerly, beset by those monks of Kosambī, makers of strife, makers of
quarrels, makers of disputes, makers of brawls, makers of legal questions in
the Order, I did not live in comfort; but now that I am alone with no other, I
am living in comfort removed from <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.504" href="#BD.4.504"></a>
those monks, makers of strife … makers of legal questions in the Order.”</p>
<p>Now a certain large bull-elephant was beset by elephants and cow-elephants, by
elephant calves and sucklings; he ate grass already cropped by them, and they
ate bundles of branches as he broke them off; and he drank muddied water and
when he crossed over at a ford the cow-elephants went pushing against his body.
Then <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.353" href="#Vin.1.353"></a>
it occurred to that large bull-elephant: “Now I am living beset by elephants
and cow-elephants … I eat grass already cropped by them and they eat bundles of
branches as I break them off; and I drink muddied water and when I cross over
at a ford the cow-elephants go pushing against my body. Suppose I were to live
alone secluded from the crowd?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.4.7" href="#Kd.10.4.7"></a>
Then that large bull-elephant, leaving the herd, approached Pārileyya, the
Guarded Woodland Thicket, the lovely <i lang="pi">sāl</i>-tree and the Lord; having approached, he set out by means of his trunk
drinking water for the Lord and water for washing, and he kept the grass down.
Then it occurred to that large bull-elephant: “Now formerly, beset by elephants
and cow-elephants, by elephant calves and sucklings, I did not live in comfort;
I ate grass already cropped by them and they ate bundles of branches as I broke
them off; I drank muddied water and when I crossed over at a ford the
cow-elephants went pushing against me; but now that I am alone with no other I
am living in comfort removed from the elephants, the cow-elephants, the
elephant calves and sucklings.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord, having understood his own seclusion and knowing by mind that
bull-elephant’s reasoning of mind, at that time uttered this utterance:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Herein agreeth mind with mind, <br>
of sageand bull-elephant of plough-pole tusks,<br>

Then the Lord, having stayed at Pārileyya as long as he found suiting, set out
on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour in due course he arrived at Sāvatthī. The
Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then the lay-followers of Kosambī thought: ‘These masters the monks of Kosambī,
have done us much mischief; the Lord is departing, harassed by these; come, we
should neither greet the masters, the monks of Kosambī, nor should we stand up
before them, nor should we salute them with joined palms or perform the proper
duties; we should not revere, respect, esteem or honour them, and neither
should we give them almsfood when they come (to us); thus they, when they are
neither revered, respected, esteemed nor honoured by us, will depart unrevered,
or they will leave the Order, or they will reconcile themselves to the Lord’.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.2" href="#Kd.10.5.2"></a>
Then the lay-followers of Kosambī neither greeted the monks of Kosambī, nor
stood up before them, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.354" href="#Vin.1.354"></a>
they did not salute them with joined palms or perform the proper duties, they
did not revere, respect, esteem or honour them and they did not give them
almsfood when they came (to them). Then the monks of Kosambī, as they were not
being revered, respected, esteemed or honoured by the lay-followers of Kosambī,
spoke thus: “Come now, your reverences, let us, having gone to Sāvatthī, settle
this legal question in the Lord’s presence.”</p>
<h2>On eighteen cases</h2>
<p>Then the monks of Kosambī, having packed away their lodgings, taking their
bowls and robes, approached Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.3" href="#Kd.10.5.3"></a>
Then the venerable Sāriputta heard: “It is said that the monks of Kosambī,
makers of strife, makers of quarrels, makers of disputes, makers of brawls,
makers of legal questions in the Order, are coming to Sāvatthī.” Then the
venerable Sāriputta approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the
Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord: “It is
said, Lord, that the monks of Kosambī, makers of strife … makers of legal
questions in the Order, are coming to Sāvatthī. How am I, Lord, to behave in
regard to these monks?”</p>
<p>“Well now, Sāriputta, as <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is so must you stand.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.506" href="#BD.4.506"></a>
“How am I, Lord, to find out what is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and what is non-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.4" href="#Kd.10.5.4"></a>

Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid heard: “It is said that the monks of Kosambī …
<span class="add">as in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.5.3">Kd.10.5.3</a></span> … are coming to Sāvatthī.” Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid approached the Lord;
having approached, having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance.
As she was standing at a respectful distance Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid spoke
thus to the Lord: “It is said, Lord, that the monks of Kosambī … are coming to
Sāvatthī. How am I, Lord, to behave in regard to these monks?”</p>
<p>“Well then, do you, Gotami, hear
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> on both sides; having heard <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> on both sides, choose the views and the approval and the persuasion and the

Anāthapiṇḍika the householder heard: “It is said that the monks of Kosambī …
are coming to Sāvatthī.” Then Anāthapiṇḍika the householder approached the
Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Anāthapiṇḍika the
householder spoke thus to the Lord: “It is said, Lord, that the monks of
Kosambī … are coming to Sāvatthī. How am I, Lord, to behave in regard to these
monks?”</p>
<p>“Well then, do you, householder, give gifts to both sides; having given gifts
to both sides, hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> on both sides; having heard <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> on both sides, choose the views and the approval and the persuasion and the

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.9" href="#Kd.10.5.9"></a>
Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, heard: “It is said that the monks of Kosambī
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.356" href="#Vin.1.356"></a>
… are coming to Sāvatthī.” Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, approached the Lord;
having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful
distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance Visākhā, Migāra’s
mother, spoke thus to the Lord: “It is said, Lord, that the monks of Kosambī …

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.10" href="#Kd.10.5.10"></a>
Then in due course the monks of Kosambī arrived at Sāvatthī. Then the venerable
Sāriputta approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he
sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful
distance, the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord: “They say, Lord, that
these monks of Kosambī, makers of strife … makers of legal questions in the
Order, have arrived at Sāvatthī. Now what line of conduct, Lord, should be
followed in regard to lodgings for these monks?”</p>
<p>“Well now, Sāriputta, separate lodgings should be given (to them).”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.509" href="#BD.4.509"></a>
“But if, Lord, there are no separate lodgings what line of conduct should be
followed?”</p>
<p>“Well then, Sāriputta, having made (some) separate they should be given. <span class="rule">But I in no way say this, Sāriputta, that a senior monk’s lodging should be
withheld (from him). Whoever should withhold it, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<p>“But what line of conduct, Lord, is to be followed in regard to material
gains?”</p>
<p>“Material gains, Sāriputta, should be distributed equally amongst all.”</p>
<h2>Allowance to restore</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.11" href="#Kd.10.5.11"></a>
Then while that monk who had been suspended was reflecting on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, it occurred to him: “This is an offence, this is not no
offence, I have fallen, I am not unfallen, I am suspended, I am not
unsuspended, I am suspended by a (formal) act that is legally valid,
irreversible, fit to stand.” Then the suspended monk approached those monks who
were taking the part of the suspended (one); having approached, he spoke thus
to those monks who were taking the part of the suspended (one): “This is an
offence, your reverences, it is not no offence … fit to stand. Come, venerable
ones, restore me.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.12" href="#Kd.10.5.12"></a>
Then those monks who were taking the part of the suspended (one), taking that
suspended monk (with them) approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. As they were sitting
down at a respectful distance, those monks spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, this
suspended monk speaks thus: ‘This is an offence, your reverences … Come,
venerable ones, restore me’. What line of conduct, Lord, is to be followed in
these circumstances?”</p>
<p>“This, monks, is an offence, this is not no offence, this monk has fallen, this
monk is not unfallen, this monk is suspended, this monk is not <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.357" href="#Vin.1.357"></a>
unsuspended, he was suspended by a legally valid (formal) act, irreversible,
fit to stand But since, monks, that monk who has fallen and was suspended sees
(his offence)—well then, monks, restore that monk.”</p>
<h2>On harmony in the Saṅgha</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.13" href="#Kd.10.5.13"></a>
Then these monks who were taking the part of the suspended
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.510" href="#BD.4.510"></a>
(one), having restored that suspended monk, approached the monks who had
suspended (him), having approached, they spoke thus to the monks who had
suspended (him): “Concerning that case, your reverences, about which there was
for the Order strife, quarrels, contention, disputes, schism in the Order,
dissension in the Order, altercation in the Order, differences in the Order
that monk has fallen and was suspended, but he sees and is restored. Now, your
reverences, let us achieve unanimity in the Order for settling this case.” Then
those monks who had suspended (him) approached the Lord; having approached,
having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. As they were
sitting down at a respectful distance, they spoke thus to the Lord: “These
monks, Lord, who are taking the part of the suspended (monk) speak thus:
‘Concerning that case … for settling this case.’ Now what line of conduct,
Lord, is to be followed?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.5.14" href="#Kd.10.5.14"></a>
“Since, monks, that monk has fallen and was suspended but sees and is
restored—well then, monks, achieve unanimity in the Order for settling that
case. And thus, monks, should it be achieved: One and all should gather
together, both the ill and the well, leave of absence should not be declared on
account of anyone. Having gathered together, the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Concerning that case about which
there was for the Order strife, quarrel, contention, dispute, schism in the
Order … differences in the Order—that monk has fallen and was suspended, but he
sees and is restored. If it seems right to the Order the Order should achieve
unanimity in the Order for settling this case. This is the motion. Honoured
sirs, let the Order listen to me. Concerning that case … and is restored. The
Order is achieving unanimity in the Order for settling this case. If the
achieving of unanimity in the Order for settling this case is pleasing to the
venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should
speak. Unanimity in the Order for settling that case is achieved by the Order.
Dissension in the Order is put down, schism in the Order is put down. It is
pleasing to the venerable ones; therefore they are silent. Thus do I understand
this</span>’. Observance may be carried out at once, the Pātimokkha recited.”

<h2>Questions of Upāli on harmony in the Saṅgha</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.10.6"></a>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.511" href="#BD.4.511"></a>
Then the venerable Upāli approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted
the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the venerable Upāli spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, in
regard to a case where there is strife for an Order … differences for an Order,
if the Order not having investigated that case, not having got to the root of
it, achieves unanimity in the Order, is that unanimity in the Order legally
valid, Lord?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, in regard to a case where there is strife for an Order … that unanimity
is not legally valid, Upāli.”</p>
<p>“But, Lord, in regard to a case where there is strife for an Order …
differences in an Order, if the Order having investigated that case, having got
to the root of it, achieves unanimity in the Order, is that unanimity in the
Order legally valid, Lord?”</p>
<p>“Upāli, in regard to a matter where there is strife for an Order, quarrels,
contention, dispute, schism in an Order, dissension in an Order, altercation in
an Order, differences in an Order, if the Order, having investigated that case,
having got to the root of it, achieves unanimity in the Order, that unanimity
in the Order is legally valid, Upāli.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.6.2" href="#Kd.10.6.2"></a>
“How many (kinds of) unanimity in an Order are there, Lord?”</p>
<p>“There are these two (kinds of) unanimity in an Order, Upāli. There is, Upāli,
unanimity in an Order that has not arrived at the meaning but has arrived at
the letter; there is, Upāli, unanimity in an Order that has both arrived at the
meaning and arrived, at the letter. And what, Upāli, is unanimity in an Order
that has not arrived at the meaning but has arrived at the letter? Upāli, in
regard to a case where there is strife for an Order … differences in an Order,
if the Order, not having investigated that case, not having got to the root of
it, achieves unanimity in the Order, this is called, Upāli, unanimity in an
Order that has not arrived at the meaning but has arrived at the letter. And
what, Upāli, is unanimity in an Order that has both arrived at the meaning and
arrived at the letter? Upāli, in regard to a case where there is strife for an
Order … differences in an Order, if the Order, having investigated that case,
having got to the root <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.512" href="#BD.4.512"></a>
of it, achieves unanimity in the Order, this is called, Upāli, unanimity in an
Order that has both arrived at the meaning and arrived at the letter. These,
Upāli, are the two (kinds of) unanimity in an Order.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.10.6.3" href="#Kd.10.6.3"></a>
Then the venerable Upāli, rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe
over one shoulder, having saluted the Lord with joined palms, addressed the
Lord with verses:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“In the Order’s affairs and deliberations
<br>
and in matters arising for investigation,<br>
what kind of man is here most needed? <br>
How is a monk fit for leadership here?
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.359" href="#Vin.1.359"></a></p>
<p>“Above all, one blameless in moral habit, <br>
of careful conduct, his faculties well controlled,<br>
opponents do not censure him in respect of a rule, <br>
for there could be nothing to say against him.</p>
<p>“Such a one, firm in purity of moral habit, <br>
is confident, he speaks ably,<br>
he is not afraid at an assembly, he does not tremble, <br>
he does not sacrifice the meaning to irrevelant talk.</p>
<p>“When asked a question in an assembly, <br>
he neither hesitates nor is ashamed, <br>
his timely sensible words, <br>
fitting as explanation, delight the learned assembly.</p>
<p>“With esteem for senior monks <br>
and confident in his own teachers, able to weigh, <br>
familiar with what should be spoken, <br>
and skilled in obstructing his opponents,</p>
<p>Opponents come under his control, <br>
and the many-folk come under his tuition,<br>
and he does not neglect his own creed, <br>
(skilful) at question and answer, unhurting.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.513" href="#BD.4.513"></a>
“Able in doing a messenger’s duty, <br>
and well-informed in what they tell him of the Order’s affairs,<br>
sent by a group of monks he is obedient, <br>
but he does not therefore think, ‘<em>I</em> am doing this’.</p>
<p>“Into whatever matters one falls, <br>
whatever is an offence and how one removes it—<br>
both these analyses are well handed down to him.<br>
He is skilled in the features of offences and removal,</p>
<p>“Being sent away and good habits—he goes by these: <br>
he is sent away and what are the grounds,<br>
restoration of a person who has completed this—<br>
he knows this too, skilled (as he is) in analysis.</p>
<p>“With esteem for senior monks, for newly ordained, <br>
for elders and for those of middle standing,<br>
a helper of the multitude, clever herein, <br>
monk such as this is fit for leadership here.”</p>
