Now at that time, a century after the Lord had attained <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>, monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī promulgated ten points at Vesālī, saying:</p>
<ol>
<li>“The practice concerning a horn for salt is allowable;</li>
<li>the practice as to two finger-breadths is allowable;</li>
<li>the practice concerning ‘among the villages’ is allowable;</li>
<li>the practice concerning residences is allowable;</li>
<li>the practice concerning assent is allowable;</li>
<li>the practice concerning what is customary is allowable;</li>
<li>the practice concerning unchurned butter-milk is allowable;</li>
<li>it is allowable to drink unfermented toddy;</li>
<li>a piece of cloth to sit upon that has no border is allowable;</li>
<li>gold and silver are allowable.”</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, walking on tour
among the Vajjis, arrived at Vesālī. Then the venerable Yasa, the son of
Kākaṇḍakā, stayed there at Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Hall of the Gabled
Roof. Now at that time the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī, having on that
Observance day filled a bronze pot with water, having set it in the midst of
the Order of monks, spoke thus to lay-followers of Vesālī who came: “Give,
sirs, a <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇa</i> for the Order and half a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> and a stamped <i lang="pi">māsaka</i>; there will be something to be done for the Order in respect of requisites.”</p>
<p>When they had spoken thus, the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, spoke thus
to the lay-followers of Vesālī: “Do <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.408" href="#BD.5.408"></a>
not, sirs, give <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇas</i> and stamped <i lang="pi">māsakas</i> to the Order: gold and silver are not allowable to recluses, sons of the
Sakyans. The recluses, sons of the Sakyans do not consent (to accept) gold and
silver, the recluses, sons of the Sakyans do not receive gold and silver, the
recluses, sons of the Sakyans do not use jewels and refined gold, they have
done with gold and silver.” Then the lay-followers of Vesālī, being spoken to
thus by the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, nevertheless gave <i lang="pi">kahāpaṇas</i> … and stamped <i lang="pi">māsakas</i> to the Order. Then the monks who were Vajjis or Vesālī, having towards the end
of that night arranged those gold coins, distributed portions according to the
number of monks. Then the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī spoke thus to the
venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.295" href="#Vin.2.295"></a></p>
<p>“This portion of gold coins is for you, reverend Yasa.”</p>
<p>“I have no need of a portion of gold coins, sirs, I do not consent (to accept)
gold coins.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.2" href="#Kd.22.1.2"></a>
Then the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī, saying: “This reverend Yasa, the son
of Kākaṇḍakā, is reviling and abusing lay-followers who are faithful and
believing; come, let us carry out a (formal) act of reconciliation for him,”
carried out a (formal) act of reconciliation for him. Then the venerable Yasa,
the son of Kākaṇḍakā spoke thus to the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī:</p>
<p>“It was laid down by the Lord, your reverences, that a companion messenger
should be given to a monk for whom a (formal) act of reconciliation has been
carried out. Your reverences, give me a monk as companion messenger.”</p>
<p>Then the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī, having agreed upon one monk, gave him
to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, as a companion messenger. Then the
venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, having entered Vesālī together <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.409" href="#BD.5.409"></a>
with the monk who was his companion messenger, spoke thus to the lay-followers
of Vesālī:</p>
<p>“It is said that I revile and abuse the venerable lay-followers who are
faithful and believing, and that I afford little satisfaction in that I speak
of not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; in that I speak of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of not-discipline as not-discipline, in that I speak of
discipline as discipline.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.3" href="#Kd.22.1.3"></a>
“Friends, the Lord was once staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There, friends, the Lord addressed the monks,
saying: ‘Monks, there are these four stains of the moon and the sun, stained by
which stains the moon and the sun burn not, shine not, blaze not. What are the
four? Dense cloud, monks, is a stain of the moon and the sun, stained by which
stain the moon and the sun … blaze not. A snow-cloud … Smoke and dust … Rāhu,
monks, is a stain of the moon and the sun, stained by which stain the moon and
the sun burn not, shine not, blaze not. These, monks, are the four stains of
the moon and the sun, stained by which stains the moon and the sun burn not,
shine not, blaze not.</p>
<p>“‘Even so, monks, there are four stains of recluses and brahmins, stained by
which stains some recluses and brahmins burn not, shine not, blaze not. What
are the four? There are, monks, some recluses and brahmins who drink fermented
liquor, who drink spirits, abstaining not from drinking fermented liquor and
spirits. This, monks, is the first stain of recluses and brahmins, stained by
which stain some recluses and brahmins burn not, shine not, blaze not. And
again, monks, some recluses and brahmins <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.296" href="#Vin.2.296"></a>
indulge in sexual intercourse, abstaining not from sexual intercourse. This,
monks, is the second stain … And again, monks, some recluses and brahmins
consent (to accept) gold and silver <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.410" href="#BD.5.410"></a>
abstaining not from accepting gold and silver. This, monks, is the third stain
… And again, monks, some recluses and brahmins earn a living by a wrong mode of
livelihood, abstaining not from a wrong mode of livelihood. This, monks, is the
fourth stain, stained by which stain some recluses and brahmins … blaze not.
These, monks, are the four stains of recluses and brahmins, stained by which
stains some recluses and brahmins burn not, shine not, blaze not.’ Friends, the
Lord said this; the Well-farer having said this, the Teacher further spoke
thus:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>“Some recluses and brahmins are stained<br>
By lust and ill-will. Clothed in ignorance,<br>
Beings delight in pleasure-giving shapes;<br>
Liquor fermented and distilled they drink;<br>
They follow sexual lust; by folly blinded<br>
Some recluses and brahmins take gifts<br>
Of gold and silver and live wrongfully.</p>
<p>These are called “stains” by the Awakened One,<br>
The kinsman of the Sun. Tainted by these<br>
Some recluses and brahmins burn not,<br>
They shine not, tarnished, dust-soiled, utter fools,<br>
Shrouded in darkness; slaves of craving they,<br>
Led by the cord of craving, and they swell<br>
The dreadful charnel-field and take on again-becoming.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It is for speaking thus that it is said that I am reviling and abusing the
venerable lay followers who are faithful and believing, and that I afford
little satisfaction in that I speak of not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of not-discipline as not-discipline, and in that I speak of
discipline as discipline.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.4" href="#Kd.22.1.4"></a>
“Friends, the Lord was once staying at Rājagaha in the
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.411" href="#BD.5.411"></a>
Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time, friends, in the
king’s private quarters this conversation arose among the king’s assembly as
they were gathered together and sitting down: ‘Gold and silver are allowable
for the recluses, sons of the Sakyans; the recluses, sons of the Sakyans
consent (to accept) gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the Sakyans receive
gold and silver.’ Now at that time, friends, a village headman, Maṇicūḷaka, was
sitting down in that assembly. Then, friends, Maṇicūḷaka, the village headman,
spoke thus to that assembly: ‘Do not, masters, speak thus. Gold and silver are
not allowable to recluses, sons of the Sakyans; the recluses, sons of the
Sakyans do not consent (to accept) gold and silver; the recluses, sons of the
Sakyans do not receive gold and silver; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.297" href="#Vin.2.297"></a>
the recluses, sons of the Sakyans do not use gold and silver, they have done
with gold and silver.’ And, friends, Maṇicūḷaka, the village headman, was able
to convince that assembly. Then, friends, Maṇicūḷaka the village headman,
having convinced that assembly approached the Lord; having approached, having
greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down
at a respectful distance, Maṇicūḷaka the village headman, spoke thus to the
Lord: ‘Now, Lord, in the king’s private quarters …  I was able, Lord, to
convince that assembly. I hope that I, Lord, maintaining thus, am one who
asserts (fairly) what has been affirmed, and am not misrepresenting the Lord by
what is not fact, but am maintaining a doctrine which conforms to his doctrine,
and that no one who is a fellow <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-man, a holder of (his) views, comes to a position incurring blame.’</p>
<p>“‘Certainly you, village headman, maintaining thus, are one who asserts
(fairly) what I have affirmed, and are not misrepresenting me by what is not
fact, but are maintaining a doctrine which conforms to my doctrine, and no one
who is a fellow <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-man, a holder of (my) views, comes to a position incurring blame. For, village
headman, gold and silver are not allowable to recluses, sons of the Sakyans;
the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.412" href="#BD.5.412"></a>
recluses, sons of the Sakyans do not consent (to accept) gold and silver; the
recluses, sons of the Sakyans do not receive gold and silver; the recluses,
sons of the Sakyans do not use gold and silver, they have done with gold and
silver. To whoever, village headman, gold and silver are allowable to him also
are allowable the five strands of sense-pleasures; to whoever the five strands
of sense-pleasures are allowable, certainly you may understand, village
headman, (this to be) not the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> of recluses, not the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> of sons of the Sakyans. Although I, village headman, spoke thus: Grass may be
looked about for by one who needs grass; wood may be looked about for by one
who needs wood; a wagon may be looked about for by one who needs a wagon; a man
may be looked about for by one who needs a man—yet I, village headman, have
never said in any way that gold and silver may be consented to or looked about
for.’ It is for speaking thus that it is said that I am reviling and abusing
venerable lay-followers who are faithful and believing, and that I afford
little satisfaction in that I speak of not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of not-discipline as not-discipline, in that I speak of
discipline as discipline.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.5" href="#Kd.22.1.5"></a>
“Once, friends, when the Lord was in Rājagaha, as before, he objected in
connection with Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, to gold and silver and laid
down a rule of training. It is for speaking thus that it is said that I am
reviling and abusing venerable lay-followers who are faithful and believing,
and that I afford little satisfaction in that I <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.298" href="#Vin.2.298"></a>
speak of not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as not-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, in that I speak of not-discipline as not-discipline, in that I speak of
discipline as discipline.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.6" href="#Kd.22.1.6"></a>
When he had spoken thus the lay-followers of Vesālī spoke thus to Yasa, the son
of Kākaṇḍakā: “Honoured sir, master Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, is alone a
recluse, a son of the Sakyans; these, one and all, are not recluses, not sons
of the Sakyans. Honoured sir, let master Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, stay in
Vesālī and we will make an effort in regard to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.413" href="#BD.5.413"></a>
the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, having convinced the
lay-followers of Vesālī, went to a monastery together with the monk who was his
companion messenger.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.7" href="#Kd.22.1.7"></a>
Then the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī asked the monk who was the companion
messenger, saying: “Your reverence, have the lay-followers of Vesālī been asked
for forgiveness by Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, evil has been done to us; Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, is
alone regarded as a recluse, a son of the Sakyans; we, one and all, are
regarded as not recluses, not sons of the Sakyans.”</p>
<p>Then the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī, saying: “Your reverences, this Yasa,
the son of Kākaṇḍakā, not agreed upon by us, has given information to
householders. Come, let us carry out a (formal) act of suspension against him.”
And these gathered together desirous of carrying out a (formal) act of
suspension against him. Then the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, having
risen above the ground, reappeared at Kosambī. Then the venerable Yasa, the son
of Kākaṇḍakā, sent a messenger to the monks of Pāvā and (to those) of the
southern region of Avantī, saying:</p>
<p>“Let the venerable ones come, we must attend to this legal question before what
is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> shines forth and <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is withheld, (before) what is not discipline shines forth and discipline is
withheld, before those who speak what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> become strong and those who speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> become feeble, (before) those who speak what is not discipline become strong
and those who speak discipline become feeble.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.8" href="#Kd.22.1.8"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Sambhūta, a wearer of
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.414" href="#BD.5.414"></a>
coarse hempen cloth, was staying on Ahogaṅgā mountain slope Then the venerable
Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, approached Ahogaṅgā mountain slope and the
venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth; having approached,
having greeted the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth, he
sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful
distance the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, spoke thus to the venerable
Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, these monks, Vajjis of Vesālī, are promulgating ten points: the
practice concerning a horn for salt is allowable; the practice as to five
finger-breadths is allowable; the practice concerning ‘among the villages’ is
allowable; the practice concerning residences is allowable; the practice
concerning assent is allowable; the practice concerning what is customary is
allowable; the practice concerning unchurned buttermilk is allowable; it is
allowable to drink unfermented toddy; a piece of cloth to sit upon that has no
border is allowable; gold and silver are allowable. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.299" href="#Vin.2.299"></a>
Come, honoured sir, we must attend to this legal question before what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> shines forth and <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is withheld, (before) what is not discipline shines forth and discipline is
withheld, before those who speak what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> become strong and those who speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> become feeble, (before) those who speak what is not discipline become strong
and those who speak discipline become feeble.”</p>
<p>“Very well, your reverence,” the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse
hempen cloth, answered the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā in assent. Then
as many as sixty monks of Pāvā, all forest-dwellers, all almsmen, all rag-robe
wearers, all wearers of the three robes, one and all men perfected, gathered
together on Ahogaṅgā mountain slope; and as many as eighty-eight monks of the
southern region of Avantī, mostly forest-dwellers, mostly almsmen, mostly
rag-robe wearers, mostly wearers of the three robes, and one and all men
perfected, gathered together on Ahogaṅgā mountain slope.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.9" href="#Kd.22.1.9"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.415" href="#BD.5.415"></a>
Then as these monks who were elders were considering, it occurred to them:
“Now, this legal question is hard and troublesome. How can we acquire a faction
through which we could be stronger in regard to this legal question?” Now at
that time the venerable Revata was staying in Soreyya. He had heard much, he
was one to whom the tradition had been handed down, he was an expert in <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, expert in discipline, expert in the headings; wise, experienced, clever;
conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training. Then it occurred to the monks
who were elders:</p>
<p>“This venerable Revata is staying in Soreyya. He has heard much … desirous of
training. If we could acquire the venerable Revata for the faction, thus could
we be stronger in regard to this legal question.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Revata, through the condition of deva-like hearing which was
purified, surpassing that of men, heard these monks who were elders as they
were considering. And having heard them, it occurred to him: ‘This legal
question is hard and troublesome, yet it is not suitable for me to hold back
from a legal question like this. But these monks are coming now. I will get no
comfort crowded up by them. Suppose that I should go away beforehand?’</p>
<p>Then the venerable Revata went from Soreyya to Saṁkassa. Then the monks who
were elders, having arrived at Soreyya, asked: “Where is the venerable Revata?”
They spoke thus: “The venerable Revata has gone to Saṁkassa.” Then the
venerable Revata went from Saṁkassato Kaṇṇakujja. Then the monks who were
elders, having arrived at Saṁkassa, asked: “Where is the venerable Revata?”
They spoke thus: “This venerable Revata has gone to Kaṇṇakujja.” Then the
venerable Revata went from Kaṇṇakujja to Udumbara. Then the monks who were
elders, having arrived at Kaṇṇakujja, asked: “Where is the venerable Revata?”
They spoke thus: “This venerable Revata has gone to Udumbara.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.300" href="#Vin.2.300"></a>
Then the venerable Revata went from Udumbara to Aggaḷapura. Then the monks who
were elders, having arrived at Udumbara, asked: “Where is the venerable
Revata?” They spoke <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.416" href="#BD.5.416"></a>
thus: “This venerable Revata has gone to Aggaḷapura.” Then the venerable Revata
went from Aggaḷapura to Sahajāti. Then the monks who were elders, having
arrived at Aggaḷapura, asked: “Where is the venerable Revata?” They spoke thus:
“This venerable Revata has gone to Sahajāti.” Then the monks who were elders
met the venerable Revata at Sahajāti.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.1.10" href="#Kd.22.1.10"></a>
Then the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth, spoke thus to
the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā: “Your reverence, this venerable
Revata has heard much, he is one to whom the tradition has been handed down, he
is an expert in <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, expert in discipline, expert in the headings; wise, experienced, clever;
conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training. If we were to ask the
venerable Revata a question, the venerable Revata would be capable of spending
a whole night over just the one question. But now the venerable Revata will
call upon a monk who is a pupil and a plain-song repeater. Do you, when that
monk has completed the plain-song intonation, having approached the venerable
Revata, ask him about these ten points.”</p>
<p>“Very well, honoured sir,” the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, answered
the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth, in assent. Then the
venerable Revata called upon the monk who was a pupil and a plain-song
repeater. Then when that monk had completed the plain-song intonation, the
venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, approached the venerable Revata; having
approached, having greeted the venerable Revata, he sat down at a respectful
distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Yasa,
the son of Kākaṇḍakā, spoke thus to the venerable Revata:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning a horn for salt allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning a horn for salt?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to carry about salt in a horn, thinking, ‘I will
enjoy whatever may be unsalted’?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning two finger-breadths allowable?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.417" href="#BD.5.417"></a>
“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning two finger-breadths?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to eat a meal at the wrong time when the shadow
has passed beyond two finger-breadths?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning ‘among the villages’ allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning ‘among the villages’?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable, thinking, ‘I will go now among the villages,’
having eaten, being satisfied, to eat a meal that is not left over?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning residences allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning residences?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable for several residences belonging to the same
boundary to carry out various Observances?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, it is not allowable.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.301" href="#Vin.2.301"></a>
</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning assent allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning assent?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable for an incomplete Order to carry out a (formal)
act, thinking, ‘We will advise monks who arrive’?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning what is customary allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning what is customary?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable, thinking, ‘This is habitually done by my
preceptor, this is habitually done by my teacher,’ to conduct oneself according
to that?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, the practice concerning what is customary is sometimes
allowable, sometimes not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning unchurned buttermilk allowable?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.418" href="#BD.5.418"></a>
“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning unchurned buttermilk?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable, having eaten, being satisfied, to drink
whatever is milk that is not left over but which has passed the stage of being
milk (although) it has not arrived at the stage of being curds?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to drink unfermented toddy?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this toddy?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to drink whatever is fermented liquor (but)
which has not fermented and has not arrived at the stage of being strong
drink?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is a piece of cloth to sit upon that has no border allowable?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, are gold and silver allowable?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, they are not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, these monks who are Vajjis of Vesālī are promulgating these ten
points in Vesālī. Come, honoured sir, we must attend to this legal question
before what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> shines forth and <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is withheld, (before) what is not discipline shines forth and discipline is
withheld, before those who speak what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> become strong and those who speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> become feeble (before) those who speak what is not discipline become strong
and those who speak discipline become feeble.”</p>
<p>“Very well, your reverence,” the venerable Revata answered the venerable Yasa,
the son of Kākaṇḍakā in assent.</p>
<p class="end">The First Portion for Repeating.</p>
<h2>Second recitation section</h2>
<p>The monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī heard: “They say that Yasa, the son of
Kākaṇḍakā, is willing to attend to this legal question, is looking about for a
faction, and they say that he is acquiring a faction.” Then it occurred to the
monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī: “This legal question is hard and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.419" href="#BD.5.419"></a>
troublesome. How could we acquire a faction through which we could be stronger
in regard to this legal question?” Then it occurred to the monks who were
Vajjis of Vesālī: “This venerable Revata is one who has heard much, one to whom
the tradition has been handed down, he is expert in <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, expert in discipline, expert in the headings; he is wise, experienced,
clever; conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training. If we could acquire
the venerable Revata for the faction, thus could we be stronger in regard to
this legal question.”</p>
<p>Then the monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī prepared abundant requisites for
recluses—bowls and robes and pieces of cloth to sit upon and needle-cases and
waistbands and strainers and regulation water-pots. Then the monks who were
Vajjis of Vesālī, taking these requisites of recluses, went in a boat upstream
to Sahājati; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.302" href="#Vin.2.302"></a>
having disembarked from the boat, they participated in a meal at the root of a
certain tree.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.22.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.2" href="#Kd.22.2.2"></a>
Then as the venerable Sāḷha was meditating in private a reasoning arose in his
mind thus: “Which now are the speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>—the monks from the East or those from Pāvā?” Then as the venerable Sāḷha was
considering <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline it occurred to him: “The monks from the East are not speakers
of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; the monks of Pāvā are speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.” Then a certain <i lang="pi">devatā</i> of the Pure Abodes, knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of the venerable
Sāḷha, as a strong man might stretch out his bent back arm or might bend back
his outstretched arm, even so, vanishing from the devas of the Pure Abodes, did
she appear before the venerable Sāḷha. Then that <i lang="pi">devatā</i> spoke thus to the venerable Sāḷha: “It is right, honoured Sāḷha, the monks
from the East are not speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the monks of Pāvā are speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Well then, revered Sāḷha, stand firm according to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p>“Both formerly and now I, <i lang="pi">devatā</i>, have stood firm according to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Nevertheless I am not making known my views until I may be agreed upon in
regard to this legal question.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.3" href="#Kd.22.2.3"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.420" href="#BD.5.420"></a>
Then those monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī, taking those requisites for
recluses, approached the venerable Revata; having approached, they spoke thus
to the venerable Revata: “Honoured sir, let the Order accept these requisites
for recluses—bowls and robes and pieces of cloth to sit upon and needle-cases
and waistbands and strainers and regulation water-pots.”</p>
<p>He said: “No, your reverences, I am complete as to the three robes” (for) he
did not want to accept. Now at that time a monk named Uttara, of twenty years’
standing was the venerable Revata’s attendant. Then the monks who were Vajjis
of Vesālī approached the venerable Uttara; having approached, they spoke thus
to the venerable Uttara: “Let the venerable Uttara accept these requisites for
recluses—bowls and … regulation water-pots.”</p>
<p>He said: “No, your reverences, I am complete as to the three robes,” (for) he
did not want to accept. They said: “Reverend Uttara, people used to bring
requisites for recluses to the Lord. If the Lord accepted them, they were glad;
but if the Lord did not accept them, they brought them to the venerable Ānanda,
saying: ‘Honoured sir, let the elder accept these requisites for recluses, thus
will this (gift) be as though accepted by the Lord.’ Let the venerable Uttara
accept <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.303" href="#Vin.2.303"></a>
these requisites of recluses, thus will this (gift) be as though accepted by
the elder.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Uttara, being pressed by the monks who were Vajjis of
Vesālī, took one robe, saying: “Let the reverend ones tell me what they have
need of.”</p>
<p>“Let the venerable Uttara say this much to the elder: ‘Honoured sir, let the
elder say this much in the midst of the Order: Awakened Ones, Lords, arise in
the Eastern districts, the monks from the East are speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the monks of Pāvā are speakers of what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>’.”</p>
<p>“Very well, your reverences,” and the venerable Uttara, having answered the
monks who were Vajjis of Vesālī in assent, approached the venerable Revata;
having approached, he spoke thus to the venerable Revata: “Honoured sir, let
the elder say this much in the midst of the Order: Awakened Ones, Lords, arise
in the Eastern districts, the monks from the East are speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the monks of Pāvā are speakers of what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.421" href="#BD.5.421"></a>
Saying: “You, monk, are inciting me to what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,” the elder dismissed the venerable Uttara. Then the monks who were Vajjis of
Vesālī spoke thus to the venerable Uttara: “What, reverend Uttara, did the
elder say?”</p>
<p>“Evil has been done to us, your reverences. Saying, ‘You, monk, are inciting me
to what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,’ the elder dismissed me.”</p>
<p>“Are not you, your reverence, a senior of twenty years’ standing?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences.”</p>
<p>“Then we shall take up guidance under (you as) teacher.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.4" href="#Kd.22.2.4"></a>
Then the Order assembled wishing to investigate that legal question. The
venerable Revata informed the Order, saying: “<span class="kamma">Your reverences, let the Order listen to me. If we were to settle that legal
question here, it might be that the monks who had taken it up originally might
open it up for a further (formal) act. If it seems right to the Order, let the
Order settle this legal question wherever this legal question arose.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Then the monks who were elders went to Vesālī willing to investigate that legal
question. Now at that time Sabbakāmin was the name of an elder of the Order,
(the oldest) on earth; it was a hundred and twenty years since his ordination;
he had shared the cell of the venerable Ānanda, and he was staying at Vesālī.
Then the venerable Revata spoke thus to the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of
coarse hempen cloth: “I, your reverence, am going up to the dwelling-place
where the venerable Sabbākamin is staying. Do you, having gone up early to the
venerable Sabbākamin, ask him about these ten points.”</p>
<p>“Very well, honoured sir,” the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen
cloth, answered the venerable Revata <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.422" href="#BD.5.422"></a>
in assent. Then the venerable Revata went up to that dwelling place where the
venerable Sabbakāmin was staying. A lodging was made ready for the venerable
Sabbakāmin in an inner room, and one for the venerable Revata on the veranda of
the inner room. Then the venerable Revata, thinking: “I This <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.304" href="#Vin.2.304"></a>
elder is old, but he is not lying down,” did not lie down to sleep. The
venerable Sabbakāmin, thinking: “This incoming monk is tired, but he is not
lying down,” did not lie down to sleep.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.5" href="#Kd.22.2.5"></a>
Then at the end of the night towards dawn, the venerable Sabbakāmin spoke thus
to the venerable Revata: “Because of what abiding do you, dear, abide now in
the fullness thereof?”</p>
<p>“Because of abiding in loving-kindness, do I, honoured sir, abide now in the
fullness thereof.”</p>
<p>“They say that you, dear, because of abiding in friendship now abide in the
fullness thereof. This abiding in friendship, beloved, this is
loving-kindness.”</p>
<p>“Formerly, honoured sir, when I was a householder loving-kindness was practised
by me, and because of that abiding in loving-kindness I now abide in the
fullness thereof, and moreover perfection was attained by me long ago. Honoured
sir, because of what abiding does the elder now abide in the fullness
thereof?”</p>
<p>“Because of abiding in (the concept of) emptiness do I, beloved, now abide in
the fullness thereof.”</p>
<p>“They say that the elder, honoured sir, because of the abiding of great men now
abides in the fullness thereof. This <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.423" href="#BD.5.423"></a>
abiding of great men, honoured sir, this is (the concept of) emptiness.”</p>
<p>“Formerly, beloved, when I was a householder emptiness was practised by me, and
because of that abiding in emptiness I now abide in the fullness thereof, and
moreover perfection was attained by me long ago.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.6" href="#Kd.22.2.6"></a>
Then this chance talk of the monks who were elders was interrupted, because the
venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth, arrived there. Then the
venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth, approached the venerable
Sabbakāmin; having approached, having greeted the venerable Sabbakāmin, he sat
down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,
the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth, spoke thus to the
venerable Sabbakāmin:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, these monks who are Vajjis of Vesālī are promulgating ten
points: the practice concerning a horn for salt is allowable … gold and silver
are allowable. Honoured sir, much <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and discipline has been mastered by the elder at the feet of a preceptor. As,
honoured sir, the elder was considering <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, what occurred to him? Who are the speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>—the monks from the East or those of Pāvā?”</p>
<p>“By you too, your reverence, has much <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline been mastered at the feet of a preceptor. As you, your
reverence, were considering <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, what occurred to you? Who are the speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>—the monks from the East or those of Pāvā?”</p>
<p>“As I, honoured sir, was considering <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, this occurred to me: ‘the monks from the East are speakers of
what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the monks of Pāvā are speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.’ Nevertheless I am not making known my views until I am agreed upon in regard
to this legal question.”</p>
<p>“As I too, your reverence, was considering
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, this occurred to me:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.305" href="#Vin.2.305"></a>
the monks from the East are speakers of what is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, the monks of Pāvā are
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.424" href="#BD.5.424"></a>
speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Nevertheless I am not making known my views until I am agreed upon in regard
to this legal question.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.7" href="#Kd.22.2.7"></a>
Then the Order assembled, willing to investigate that legal question. But while
they were investigating that legal question both endless disputations arose and
of not one speech was the meaning clear. Then the venerable Revata informed the
Order, saying: “<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. While we were investigating this
legal question both endless disputations arose and of not one speech was the
meaning clear. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may settle this legal
question by means of a referendum.</span>” He selected four monks from the East, four monks from Pāvā—of the Eastern
monks the venerable Sabbakāmin and the venerable Sāḷha and the venerable
Khujjasobhita and the venerable Vāsabhagāmika; of the monks from Pāvā the
venerable Revata and the venerable Sambhūta, the wearer of coarse hempen cloth,
and the venerable Yasa, the son of Kākaṇḍakā, and the venerable Sumana. Then
the venerable Revata informed the Order, saying:</p>
<p>“<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. While we were investigating this
legal question both endless disputations arose and of not one speech was the
meaning clear. If it seems right to the Order, the Order may agree upon the
four monks from the East and the four monks from Pāvā to settle this legal
question by means of a referendum. This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the
Order listen to me. While we were investigating this legal question … was the
meaning clear. The Order is agreeing upon the four monks from the East and the
four monks from Pāvā to settle this legal question by means of a referendum. If
the agreement upon the four monks from the East and the four monks from Pāvā to
settle this legal question by means of a referendum is pleasing to the
venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should
speak. The four monks from the East <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.425" href="#BD.5.425"></a>
and the four monks from Pāvā are agreed upon by the Order to settle this legal
question by means of a referendum. It is pleasing to the Order, therefore it is
silent. Thus do I understand this.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p>Now at that time Ajita was the name of a monk of ten years’ standing; he was a
reciter of the Pātimokkha for the Order. Then the Order further agreed upon the
venerable Ajita as appointer of seats for the monks who were elders. Then it
occurred to the monks who were elders: “Now where should we settle this legal
question?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.306" href="#Vin.2.306"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks who were elders: “This Vālika monastery is
pleasing, with little noise, with little disturbance. Suppose that we should
settle this legal question in Vālika monastery?” Then the monks who were elders
went to Vālika monastery, willing to investigate that legal question.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.8" href="#Kd.22.2.8"></a>
Then the venerable Revata informed the Order, saying: “<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, I
can ask the venerable Sabbakāmin about discipline.</span>” Then the venerable Sabbakāmin informed the Order, saying: “<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems right to the Order, I,
questioned about discipline by the venerable Revata, can answer.</span>” Then the venerable Revata spoke thus to the venerable Sabbakāmin:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning a horn for salt allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning a horn for salt?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to carry about salt in a horn, thinking: ‘I will
enjoy whatever may be unsalted’?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“In Sāvatthī, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of expiation for eating what has been stored.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This first point, investigated by
the Order, this is a point that is against <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.426" href="#BD.5.426"></a>
against discipline, not of the Teacher’s instruction. This is the first
(voting-) ticket that I cast.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning two finger-breadths allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning two finger-breadths?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to eat a meal at the wrong time if the shadow
has passed beyond two finger-breadths?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“At Rājagaha, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of expiation for eating at the wrong time.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This second point … This is the
second (voting-) ticket that I cast.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning ‘among the villages’ allowable?”</p>
<p>What, your reverence, is this practice concerning ‘among the villages’?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable, thinking: ‘I will go now among the villages,’
having eaten, being satisfied, to eat a meal that is not left over?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“At Sāvatthī, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of expiation for eating what is not left over.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This third point … This is the

boundary to carry out various Observances?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.427" href="#BD.5.427"></a>
“In Rājagaha, in what is connected with the Observance.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>An offence of wrong-doing for going beyond discipline.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This fourth point … This is the
fourth (voting-) ticket that I cast.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning assent allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is the practice concerning assent?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable for an incomplete Order to carry out a (formal)
act, thinking: ‘We will advise monks who arrive’?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi2.307" href="#Vin.2.307"></a>
</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“In a matter of discipline on things pertaining to (the monks of) Campā.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of wrong-doing for going beyond discipline.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This fifth point … This is the
fifth (voting-) ticket that I cast.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning what is customary allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this practice concerning what is customary?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable, thinking: ‘This is what is habitually done by
my preceptor, this is what is habitually done by my teacher,’ to conduct
oneself according to that?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, the practice concerning what is customary is sometimes
allowable, sometimes not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This sixth point … This is the
sixth (voting-) ticket that I cast.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is the practice concerning unchurned buttermilk allowable?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is the practice concerning unchurned buttermilk?”</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable having eaten, being satisfied, to drink whatever
is milk that is not left over but which has <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.428" href="#BD.5.428"></a>
passed the stage of being milk (although) it has not arrived at the stage of
being curds?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“At Sāvatthī, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of expiation for eating what was not left over.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This seventh point … This is the

<p>“Honoured sir, is it allowable to drink unfermented toddy?”</p>
<p>“What, your reverence, is this unfermented toddy?”</p>

has not fermented and has not arrived at the stage of being strong drink?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“At Kosambī, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of expiation for drinking fermented liquor and spirits.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This eighth point … This is the
eighth (voting-) ticket that I cast.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, is a piece of cloth to sit upon that has no border allowable?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, it is not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where was it objected to?”</p>
<p>“At Sāvatthī, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p>“An offence of expiation involving cutting down.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This ninth point … This is the
ninth (voting-) ticket that I cast.</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, are gold and silver allowable?”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, they are not allowable.”</p>
<p>“Where were they objected to?”</p>
<p>“At Rājagaha, in the Suttavibhaṅga.”</p>
<p>“What offence does one fall into?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.5.429" href="#BD.5.429"></a>
“An offence of expiation for accepting gold and silver.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This tenth point, investigated by
the Order, this is a matter that is against <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, against discipline, not of the Teacher’s instruction. This is the tenth
(voting-) ticket that I cast. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. These
ten points, investigated by the Order, these are matters that are against <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, against discipline, not of the Teacher’s instruction.”</p>
<p>“This legal question, your reverence, is concluded, and being settled is well
settled. Nevertheless you, your reverence, may also question me in the midst of
the Order on these ten points in order to convince these monks.”</p>
<p>So the venerable Revata also questioned the venerable Sabbakāmin in the midst
of the Order on these ten points, and the venerable Sabbakāmin, being
questioned, answered.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.22.2.9" href="#Kd.22.2.9"></a>
Now because seven hundred monks—not one less and not one more—were at this
chanting of the discipline, this chanting of the discipline is called “that of
the Seven Hundred.”</p>
