<h2>Allowance to enter the rains</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.1.1" href="#Kd.3.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.183" href="#BD.4.183"></a>
At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo
Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time (the use of) a
rains-residence for monks had not come to be laid down by the Lord. So these
monks walked on tour during the cold weather and the hot weather and the
rains.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.1.2" href="#Kd.3.1.2"></a>
People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these
recluses, sons of the Sakyans, walk on tour during the cold weather and the hot
weather and the rains, trampling down the crops and grasses, injuring life that
is one-facultied and bringing many small creatures to destruction? Shall it be
that those members of other sects, whose rules are badly kept, cling to and
prepare a rains-residence, shall it be that these birds, having made their
nests in the tree-tops, cling to and prepare a rains-residence, while these
recluses, sons of the Sakyans walk on a tour during the cold weather and the
hot weather and the rains, trampling down the crops and grasses, injuring life
that is one-facultied and bringing many small creatures to destruction?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.1.3" href="#Kd.3.1.3"></a>
Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this
matter to the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to enter upon the rains.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.2.1" href="#Kd.3.2.1"></a>
Then it occurred to these monks: “Now, when should the rains be entered upon?”
They told this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.184" href="#BD.4.184"></a>
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to enter upon the rains in the rainy season.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.2.2" href="#Kd.3.2.2"></a>
Then it occurred to these monks: “Now, how many (periods) are there for
beginning the rains?” They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “Monks, there
are these two (periods) for beginning the rains: the earlier and the later. The
earlier may be entered upon the day after (the full moon of) Āsāḷhī, the later
may be entered upon a month after (the full moon of) Āsāḷhī. These, monks, are
the two (periods) for beginning the rains.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.138" href="#Vin.1.138"></a></p>
<h2>On tour in the rains, etc.</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.3.1" href="#Kd.3.3.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, having entered upon the rains, walked
on tour during the rains. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these
recluses, sons of the Sakyans, walk on tour during the cold weather and the hot
weather and the rains, trampling down … <span class="add">
<em>as in</em>
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd3#Kd.3.1.2">Kd.3.1.2</a></span> … bringing many small creatures to destruction?’</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.3.2" href="#Kd.3.3.2"></a>
Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks, having entered upon
the rains, walk on tour during the rains?” Then these monks told this matter to
the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given
reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “<span class="rule">Monks, having entered upon the rains, but not having kept either the first
three months or the last three months, one should not set out on tour. Whoever
should (thus) set out, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3.4"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.4.1" href="#Kd.3.4.1"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks did not want to enter upon the rains.
They told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, one should not not enter upon the rains. Whoever should not enter upon
(them), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.4.2" href="#Kd.3.4.2"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.185" href="#BD.4.185"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, on a day for beginning the rains, not
desiring to enter upon the rains, intentionally passed a residence by. They
told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, on a day for beginning the rains, a residence should not be
intentionally passed by one who does not desire to enter upon the rains.
Whoever should pass one by, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<h2>Allowance for seven days business</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.4.3" href="#Kd.3.4.3"></a>
Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, desiring to postpone the
rains, sent a messenger to the monks, saying: “What if the masters could enter
upon the rains at the next full-moon day?” They told this matter to the Lord.
He said: “<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to obey kings.</span>”
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.139" href="#Vin.1.139"></a></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.5.1" href="#Kd.3.5.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he found suiting, set
out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour, in due course he arrived at
Sāvatthī. Then the Lord stayed there in Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in
Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time in the Kosala country a
lay-follower, Udena, had had a dwelling-place built for an Order. He sent a
messenger to monks, saying: “Let the revered sirs come; I want to give a gift
and to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to see the monks.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.5.2" href="#Kd.3.5.2"></a>
Monks spoke thus: “It is laid down by the Lord, sir, that one should not set
out on tour, having entered upon the rains and not having kept the first three
months or the last three months. Let Udena, the lay-follower, wait until the
monks have kept the rains; when they have finished the rains they will go. But
if there is something urgent to be done, let him establish the dwelling-place
in the presence of resident monks who are already there.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.5.3" href="#Kd.3.5.3"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.186" href="#BD.4.186"></a>
The lay-follower, Udena, … spread it about, saying: “How can these revered
sirs, when sent for by me, not come, for I am a benefactor, a builder, a
supporter of the Order?” Monks heard the lay-follower, Udena, as he … spread it
about Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.5.4" href="#Kd.3.5.4"></a>
Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the
monks, saying: “I allow you, monks, to go if you are sent for by seven (classes
of people), and if the business can be done in seven days, but not if you are
not sent for: by a monk, a nun, a probationer, a novice, a woman novice, a
lay-follower, a woman lay-follower. I allow you, monks, to go if you are sent
for by these (seven classes of people) and if the business can be done in seven
days, but not if you are not sent for. The return should be made in seven
days.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.5.5" href="#Kd.3.5.5"></a>
This is a case, monks, where a dwelling-place for an Order comes to have been
built by a lay-follower. If he should send a messenger to monks, saying: ‘Let
the revered sirs come, I want to give a gift and to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to see the monks you should go, monks’, if you are sent for and if the
business can be done in seven days, but not if you are not sent for. The return
should be made in seven days.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.13.1" href="#Kd.3.13.1"></a>
Now at that time an agreement came to be made by an Order in Sāvatthī that no
one should be allowed to go forth during the rains. A nephew of Visākhā,
Migāra’s mother, having approached monks, asked for the going forth. Monks
spoke thus: “Sir, an agreement was made by the Order that during the rains no
one should be allowed to go forth. Wait, sir, until the monks have kept the
rains; when they have kept the rains they will allow you to go forth.” Then
these monks, having kept the rains, spoke thus to the nephew of Visākhā,
Migāra’s mother: “Come now, sir, go forth.” He spoke thus: “Honoured sirs, if I
could have gone forth, I <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.203" href="#BD.4.203"></a>
should have been pleased. But now, I, honoured sirs, will not go forth.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.13.2" href="#Kd.3.13.2"></a>
Visākhā, Migāra’s mother … spread it about, saying: “How can the masters make
an agreement to the effect that no one should be allowed to go forth during the
rains? At what time should <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> not be followed?” Monks heard Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, as she … spread it
about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: “<span class="rule">Monks, an agreement that no one should be allowed to go forth during the rains
should not be made. Whoever should make (one), there is an offence of
wrong-doing.</span>”</p>
<h2>Offence of wrong-doing in assent</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Kd.3.14"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.14.1" href="#Kd.3.14.1"></a>
Now at that time a rains-residence belonging to King Pasenadi of Kosala came to
be assented to for the earlier period by the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans. As he was going to that residence, he saw on the way two residences
with many robes. It occurred to him: “Now, suppose I should spend the rains in
these two residences? Thus would many robes accrue to me.” He spent the rains
in these two residences. King Pasenadi of Kosala … spread it about, saying:
“How can this master Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having assented to our
rains-residence, break his word? Is not lying condemned in many a figure by the
Lord and restraint from lying extolled?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.14.2" href="#Kd.3.14.2"></a>
Monks heard King Pasenadi of Kosala as he … spread it about. Those who were
modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi1.154" href="#Vin.1.154"></a>
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having assented to a
rains-residence belonging to King Pasenadi of Kosala, break his word? Is not
lying condemned in many a figure by the Lord and restraint from lying
extolled?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.14.3" href="#Kd.3.14.3"></a>
Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion,
having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the venerable Upananda, the
son of the Sakyans, saying: “Is it true, as is said, Upananda, that you, having
assented to a rains-residence belonging to King Pasenadi of Kosala, broke your
word?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Lord.” The awakened one, the Lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.4.204" href="#BD.4.204"></a>
“How can you, foolish man, having assented to a rains-residence belonging to
King Pasenadi of Kosala, break your word? Foolish man, is not lying condemned
in many a figure by me and restraint from lying extolled? It is not, foolish
man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” and having rebuked him,
having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.14.4" href="#Kd.3.14.4"></a>
“This is a case, monks, where a rains-residence comes to be assented to by a
monk for the earlier period. As he is going to that residence he sees on the
way two residences with many robes. It occurs to him: ‘What now if I should
spend the rains in these two residences? Thus would many robes accrue to me.’
He spends the rains in these two residences. <span class="rule">Monks, the earlier period is not valid for that monk, and also there is an
offence of wrong-doing in the assent.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Kd.3.14.5" href="#Kd.3.14.5"></a>
“This is a case, monks, where a rains-residence comes to be assented to by a
monk for the earlier period. As he is going to that residence he carries out
Observance outside it, he reaches a dwelling-place on the day after the
Observance day, he prepares a lodging, he sets out drinking-water and water for
washing, he sweeps a cell, and, having nothing to do, he departs that self-same
day. <span class="rule">Monks, the earlier period is not valid for that monk, and also there is an
offence of wrong-doing in the assent.</span></p>

and there is no offence in the assent.</p>

“This is a case, monks, … and having something to do before the Invitation, he
departs for seven days. Monks, whether that monk returns or whether he does not
return to that residence, the earlier period is valid for that monk, and also
there is no offence in the assent.</p>
