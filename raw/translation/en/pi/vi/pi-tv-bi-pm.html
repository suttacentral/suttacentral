<p>[Elder Bhikkhuni] Having completed what should be done beforehand and the preliminary duties, with the assent of the Bhikkhuni Sangha, one and all, with offences confessed, I invite the recitation of the patimokkha.</p>

<h2><span class="add"><a id="nidana">The Recitation of the Introduction</a></span></h2>
<p>Venerable, let the Sangha hear me. Today is the uposatha of the fifteenth day. If the proper time has come for the Sangha, the Sangha should carry out the patimokkha.</p>
<p>What is the preliminary duty for the Sangha? Venerables, you should announce your purity. I shall recite the patimokkha. Let all of us being [present] listen and attend carefully.</p>
<p>Whoever has an offence should reveal it. There being no offence, silence should be kept. I shall know by their silence that the venerables are pure. Just as one questioned individually would have an answer; in the same way, when (the patimokkha) is proclaimed up to the third time in such an assembly as this, should any bhikkhuni not reveal an offence that she remembers, this is a conscious lie for her. Venerables, a conscious lie has been pronounced by the Blessed One to be an obstructing matter. Therefore any offence which exists is to be revealed by a bhikkhuni, who having committed an offence, remembers it and looks for purification. When revealed, it is good for her.</p>
<p>Recited, venerables is the introduction. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>

<h2><span class="add"><a id="pj">The Recitation of the Section on Defeat</a></span></h2>
<p>Herein these eight matters entailing defeat come up for recitation.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj1">Pārājika 1.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni willingly engage in the sexual act, even with a male animal, she is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj2">Pārājika 2.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, in the manner of stealing, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness—just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish her, saying, ‘You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief ’—a bhikkhuni in the same way taking what is not given is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj3">Pārājika 3.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for her, or praise the advantages of death, or incite her to die (thus): ‘My good man, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life,’ or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite her to die, she also is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj4">Pārājika 4.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, without direct knowledge, boast of a superior human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision as present in herself, saying, ‘Thus do I know; thus do I see,’ such that regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, she—being remorseful and desirous of purification—might say, ‘Venerables, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I said I see—vainly, falsely, idly,’ unless it was from over-estimation, she also is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj5">Pārājika 5.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, lusting, consent to a lusting man’s rubbing, rubbing up against, taking hold of, touching, or fondling (her) below the collar-bone and above the circle of the knees, she also is defeated and no longer in communion for being ‘one above the circle of the knees.’</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj6">Pārājika 6.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, knowing that (another) bhikkhuni has fallen into an act (entailing) defeat, neither accuse her herself nor inform the group, and then—whether she (the other bhikkhuni) is still alive or has died, has been expelled or gone over to another sect—she (this bhikkhuni) should say, ‘Even before, venerables, I knew of this bhikkhuni that “This sister is of such-and-such a sort,” and I didn’t accuse her myself nor did I inform the group,’ then she also is defeated and no longer in communion for being ‘one who concealed a fault.’</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj7">Pārājika 7.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni follow a bhikkhu suspended by a Community (of bhikkhus) acting in harmony, in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher’s instructions, and he is disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship (with the bhikkhus), the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: ‘Venerable, that bhikkhu has been suspended by a community acting harmony in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher’s instructions. He is disrespectful, he has not made amends, he has broken off his friendship. Do not follow him, venerable.’ And should that bhikkhuni, admonished thus by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then she also is defeated and no longer in communion for being ‘a follower of a suspended (bhikkhu).’</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="pj8">Pārājika 8.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, lusting, consent to a lusting man’s taking hold of her hand and touching the edge of her outer robe, and should she stand with him and converse with him and go to a rendezvous with him, and should she consent to his approaching her, and should she enter a hidden place with him, and should she dispose her body to him—(any of these) for the purpose of that unrighteous act—then she also is defeated and no longer in communion for ‘eight grounds.’</p>
<hr>
<p>Recited, venerables, are the eight matters entailing defeat. If a bhikkhuni has commited one or other of these offences, she is no longer allowed to [live in] communion with bhikkhunis; as [she was] before [ordination] so [she is] after [the confession of the offence]; she becomes defeated, not in communion. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>
<p class="endsection">The section on defeat is finished.</p>

<h2><span class="add"><a id="ss">The Recitation of the Section [Entailing] Initial and Subsequent [Meetings] of the Community</a></span></h2>
<p>Now, venerables, these seventeen matters [entailing] initial and subsequent [meetings] of the community come up for recitation.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss1">Saṅghādisesa 1.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni start a legal case against a householder, a householder’s son, a slave, or a worker, or even against a wandering contemplative: this bhikkhuni, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss2">Saṅghādisesa 2.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni knowingly ordain a woman thief sentenced to death, without having obtained permission from the king or the Community or the (governing) council or the (governing) committee or the (governing) guild—unless the woman is allowable (i.e., already ordained in another sect or with other bhikkhunis)—this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss3">Saṅghādisesa 3.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni go among villages alone or go to the other shore of a river alone or stay away for a night alone or fall behind her companion(s) alone: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss4">Saṅghādisesa 4.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni—without having obtained permission from the Community who performed the act, without knowing the desire of the group—restore a bhikkhuni whom a Community acting harmony in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher’s instructions, has suspended: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss5">Saṅghādisesa 5.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, lusting, having received staple or non-staple food from the hand of a lusting man, consume or chew it: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss6">Saṅghādisesa 6.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni say, ‘What does it matter to you whether this man is lusting or not, when you are not lusting? Please, venerable, take what the man is giving—staple or non-staple food—with your own hand and consume or chew it’: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss7">Saṅghādisesa 7.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni engage in conveying a man’s intentions to a woman or a woman’s intentions to a man, proposing marriage or paramourage—even if only for a momentary liaison: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss8">Saṅghādisesa 8.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, malicious, angered, displeased, charge a (fellow) bhikkhuni with an unfounded case involving defeat, (thinking), ‘Surely with this I may bring about her fall from the celibate life,’ then regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue is unfounded and the bhikkhuni confesses her anger: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss9">Saṅghādisesa 9.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, malicious, angered, displeased, using as a mere ploy an aspect of an issue that pertains otherwise, charge a bhikkhuni with a case involving defeat, (thinking), ‘Surely with this I may bring about her fall from the celibate life,’ then regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue pertains otherwise, an aspect used as a mere ploy, and the bhikkhuni confesses her anger: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss10">Saṅghādisesa 10.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, angry and displeased, say, ‘I repudiate the Buddha, I repudiate the Dhamma, I repudiate the Sangha, I repudiate the Training. Since when were the Sakyan-daughter contemplatives the only contemplatives? There are other contemplatives who are conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. I will practice the holy life in their company,’ the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: ‘Venerable, don’t—angry and displeased—say, “I repudiate the Buddha, I repudiate the Dhamma, I repudiate the Sangha, I repudiate the Training. Since when were the Sakyan-daughter contemplatives the only contemplatives? There are other contemplatives who are conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. I will practice the holy life in their company.” Take delight, venerable. The Dhamma is well-expounded. Follow the holy life for the right ending of suffering.’ And should that bhikkhuni, admonished thus by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss11">Saṅghādisesa 11.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, turned down in even a trifling issue, angry and displeased, say, ‘The bhikkhunis are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear,’ the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: ‘Venerable, don’t—turned down in even a trifling issue, angry and displeased—say, “The bhikkhunis are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear.” It may be that you, venerable, are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear.’ And should that bhikkhuni, admonished thus by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss12">Saṅghādisesa 12.</a></span></h4>
<p>In case bhikkhunis are living entangled, depraved in their conduct, depraved in their reputation, depraved in their notoriety (depraved in their livelihood), exasperating the Bhikkhuni Community, hiding one another’s faults, the bhikkhunis should admonish them thus: ‘The sisters are living entangled, depraved in their conduct, depraved in their reputation, depraved in their notoriety. Split up (your group), venerables. The Community recommends isolation for the sisters.’ And should those bhikkhunis, thus admonished, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke them up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times by the bhikkhunis they desist, that is good. If they do not desist, then these bhikkhunis, also, as soon as they have fallen into the third act of offence, are to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss13">Saṅghādisesa 13.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni say (to the bhikkhunis criticized in the preceding case), ‘Live entangled, venerables. Don’t live separately. There are other bhikkhunis in the Community with the same conduct, the same reputation, the same notoriety, exasperating the Bhikkhuni Community, hiding one another’s faults, but the Community doesn’t say anything to them. It’s simply because of your weakness that the Community—with contempt, scorn, intolerance, and threats—says, ‘The sisters are living entangled, depraved in their conduct, depraved in their reputation, depraved in their notoriety. Split up (your group), venerables. The Community recommends isolation for the sisters,”’ the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: ‘venerable, don’t say, “Live entangled, venerables. Don’t live separately. There are other bhikkhunis in the Community with the same conduct, the same reputation, the same notoriety, exasperating the Bhikkhuni Community, hiding one another’s faults, but the Community doesn’t say anything to them. It’s simply because of your weakness that the Community—with contempt, scorn, intolerance, and threats—says, “The sisters are living entangled, depraved in their conduct, depraved in their reputation, depraved in their notoriety. Split up (your group), venerables. The Community recommends isolation for the sisters.”’ And should that bhikkhuni, admonished thus by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss14">Saṅghādisesa 14.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni agitate for a schism in a Community in concord, or should she persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism, the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: ‘Do not, venerable, agitate for a schism in a Community in concord or persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable be reconciled with the Community, for a Community in concord, on complimentary terms, free from dispute, having a common recitation, dwells in peace.’ And should that bhikkhuni, admonished thus by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss15">Saṅghādisesa 15.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should bhikkhunis—one, two, or three—who are followers and partisans of that bhikkhuni, say, ‘Do not, venerables, admonish that bhikkhuni in any way. She is an exponent of the Dhamma, an exponent of the Vinaya. She acts with our consent and approval. She knows, she speaks for us, and that is pleasing to us,’ other bhikkhunis are to admonish them thus: ‘Do not say that, venerables. That bhikkhuni is not an exponent of the Dhamma and she is not an exponent of the Vinaya. Do not, venerables, approve of a schism in the Community. Let the venerables’ (minds) be reconciled with the Community, for a Community in concord, on complimentary terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace.’ And should those bhikkhunis, thus admonished, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke them up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times by the bhikkhunis they desist, that is good. If they do not desist, then these bhikkhunis, also, as soon as they have fallen into the third act of offence, are to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss16">Saṅghādisesa 16.</a></span></h4>
<p>In case a bhikkhuni is by nature difficult to admonish—who, when being legitimately admonished by the bhikkhunis with reference to the training rules included in the (patimokkha) recitation, makes herself unadmonishable (saying), ‘Do not, venerables, say anything to me, good or bad; and I will not say anything to the venerables, good or bad. Refrain, venerables, from admonishing me’—the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: ‘Let the venerable not make herself unadmonishable. Let the venerable make herself admonishable. Let the venerable admonish the bhikkhunis in accordance with what is right, and the bhikkhunis will admonish the venerable in accordance with what is right; for it is thus that the Blessed One’s following is nurtured: through mutual admonition, through mutual rehabilitation.’ And should that bhikkhuni, thus admonished by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to be rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="ss17">Saṅghādisesa 17.</a></span></h4>
<p>In case a bhikkhuni living in dependence on a certain village or town is a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct—whose depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families she has corrupted are both seen and heard about—the bhikkhunis are to admonish her thus: ‘You, venerable, are a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about; the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, venerable. Enough of your staying here.’ And should that bhikkhuni, thus admonished by the bhikkhunis, say about the bhikkhunis, ‘The bhikkhunis are prejudiced by favoritism, by aversion, by delusion, by fear, in that for this sort of offense they banish some and do not banish others,’ the bhikkhunis are to admonish her thus: ‘Do not say that, venerable. The bhikkhunis are not prejudiced by favoritism, by aversion, by delusion, by fear. You, venerable, are a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, venerable. Enough of your staying here.’ And should that bhikkhuni, thus admonished by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recited, venerables, are the seventeen sanghadisesas, nine being offences at once and eight after the third [admonition]. If a bhikkhuni has commited one or other of these offences, she must spend half a month on penance before both Sanghas. When the bhikkhuni has completed the penance, she is to be reinstated by a bhikkhuni Sangha of twenty. If a bhikkhuni Sangha of one less than twenty should reinstate that bhikkhuni, that bhikkhuni is not reinstated and those bhikkhunis are censurable. This is the proper course here. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>
<p class="endsection">The section on initial and subsequent meetings of the community is finished.</p>

<h2><span class="add"><a id="np">The Recitation of the Section on Confession with Forfeiture</a></span></h2>
<p>Now, venerables, these thirty matters entailing confession with forfeiture come up for recitation.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np1">Nissaggiya pācittiya 1.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni make a bowl-hoard (have more than one bowl in her possession), it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np2">Nissaggiya pācittiya 2.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having determined an out-of-season cloth to be an in-season cloth, distribute it, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np3">Nissaggiya pācittiya 3.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having exchanged robe- cloth with another bhikkhuni, later say to her, Here, venerable. This is your robe-cloth. Bring me that robe- cloth of mine. What was yours is still yours. What was mine is still mine. Bring me that one of mine. Take yours back, and then snatch it back or have it snatched back, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np4">Nissaggiya pācittiya 4.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having had one thing asked for, (then send it back and) have another thing asked for, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np5">Nissaggiya pācittiya 5.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having had one thing bought, (then send it back and) have another thing bought, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np6">Nissaggiya pācittiya 6.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, using a fund intended for one purpose, dedicated to one purpose for the Community, have something else bought, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np7">Nissaggiya pācittiya 7.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having herself asked for a fund intended for one purpose, dedicated to one purpose for the Community, use it to have something else bought, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np8">Nissaggiya pācittiya 8.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, using a fund intended for one purpose, dedicated to one purpose for a group, have something else bought, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np9">Nissaggiya pācittiya 9.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having herself asked for a fund intended for one purpose, dedicated to one purpose for a group, use it to have something else bought, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np10">Nissaggiya pācittiya 10.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni, having herself asked for a fund intended for one purpose, dedicated to one purpose for an individual, use it to have something else bought, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<p class="endsection">Part One: The Bowl Chapter</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np11">Nissaggiya pācittiya 11.</a></span></h4>
<p>When a bhikkhuni is asking for a heavy cloth, one worth four bronzes at most may be asked for. If she asks for more than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np12">Nissaggiya pācittiya 12.</a></span></h4>
<p>When a bhikkhuni is asking for a light cloth, one worth two and a half bronzes at most may be asked for. If she asks for more than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np13">Nissaggiya pācittiya 13.</a></span></h4>
<p>When a bhikkhuni has finished her robe-making and the frame is destroyed (her kathina privileges are in abeyance), she is to keep an extra robe-cloth ten days at most. Beyond that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np14">Nissaggiya pācittiya 14.</a></span></h4>
<p>When a bhikkhuni has finished her robe-making and the frame is destroyed: If she dwells apart from (any of) her five robes even for one night—unless authorized by the bhikkhunis—it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np15">Nissaggiya pācittiya 15.</a></span></h4>
<p>When a bhikkhuni has finished her robe-making and the frame is destroyed: If out-of-season robe-cloth accrues to her, she may accept it if she so desires. Once she accepts it, she is to make it up immediately. If it should not be enough, she may lay it aside for a month at most if she has an expectation for filling the lack. Should she keep it beyond that, even when there is an expectation (for further cloth), it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np16">Nissaggiya pācittiya 16.</a></span></h4>
<p>Should any bhikkhuni ask for robe-cloth from a man or woman householder unrelated to her, except at the proper occasion, it is to be forfeited and confessed. Here the proper occasion is this: The bhikkhuni’s robe has been stolen or destroyed. This is the proper occasion in this case.</p>
<h4><span class="add"><a id="np17">Nissaggiya pācittiya 17.</a></span></h4>
<p>If that unrelated man or woman householder presents the bhikkhuni with many robes (pieces of robe- cloth), she is to accept at most (enough for) an upper and an under robe. If she accepts more than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p>In case a man or woman householder prepares a robe fund for the sake of an unrelated bhikkhuni, thinking. ‘Having purchased a robe with this robe fund, I will supply the bhikkhuni named so-and-so with a robe’: If the bhikkhuni, not previously invited, approaching (the householder) should make a stipulation with regard to the robe, saying, ‘It would be good indeed, sir, if you supplied me (with a robe),’ having purchased a robe of such-and-such a sort with this robe fund—out of a desire for something fine—it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p>In case two householders—men or women—prepare separate robe funds for the sake of a bhikkhuni unrelated to them, thinking, ‘Having purchased separate robes with these separate robe funds of ours, we will supply the bhikkhuni named so-and-so with robes’: If the bhikkhuni, not previously invited, approaching (them) should make a stipulation with regard to the robe, saying, ‘It would be good indeed, sirs, if you supplied me (with a robe), having purchased a robe of such-and-such a sort with these separate robe funds, the two (funds) together for one (robe)’—out of a desire for something fine—it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p>In case a king, a royal official, a brahmin or a householder sends a robe fund for a bhikkhuni via a messenger: 'Purchase a robe with this robe fund and supply the bhikkhuni named so-&-so with a robe.' If the messenger approaches the bhikkhuni and says: 'This robe fund is for the venerable. May the venerable accept this robe fund.' Then the bhikkhuni is to tell the messenger: ‘We do not accept robe funds, friend. We accept robes at the right time.’ If the messenger says to the bhikkhuni: 'Does the venerable have a steward?' Then, if the bhikkhuni desires a robe, she may indicate a steward, either a monastery attendant or a lay follower: ‘That, sir, is the bhikkhunis’ steward.’ If the messenger instructs the steward goes to the bhikkhuni and says: ‘I have instructed the steward the venerable indicated. May the venerable go and she will supply you with a robe in season.’ Then the bhikkhuni, desiring a robe and approaching the steward, may prompt and remind her 2 or 3 times: ‘I have need of a robe.’ Should (the steward) produce the robe after being prompted and reminded 2 or 3 times, that is good. If she does not produce the robe, (the bhikkhuni) should stand in silence 4, 5, or 6 times at most for that purpose. Should (the steward) produce the robe after (the bhikkhuni) has stood in silence for the purpose 4, 5, or 6 times at most, that is good. If she should not produce the robe, but she produces the robe after (the bhikkhuni) has tried further, it is to be forfeited and confessed. If she should not produce (the robe), then the bhikkhuni herself should go to the place from which the robe fund was brought, or a messenger should be sent (to say), ‘The robe fund that you, venerable sirs, sent for the sake of the bhikkhuni has given no benefit to the bhikkhuni at all. May you be united with what is yours. May what is yours not be lost.’ This is the proper course here.</p>
