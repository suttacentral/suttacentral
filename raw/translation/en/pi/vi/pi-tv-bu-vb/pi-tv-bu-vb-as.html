<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.153" href="#BD.3.153"></a>
These seven rules, venerable ones, for the deciding of legal questions come up
for recitation. For the deciding, for the settlement of legal questions arising
from time to time:</p>
<ol>
<li> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.1" href="#Bu-As.1"></a>
A verdict in the presence of may be given;</li>
<li> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.2" href="#Bu-As.2"></a>
A verdict of innocence may be given;</li>
<li> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.3" href="#Bu-As.3"></a>
A verdict of past insanity may be given;</li>
<li> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.4" href="#Bu-As.4"></a>
It may be carried out on (his) acknowledgement;</li>
<li>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.5" href="#Bu-As.5"></a>
(There is) the decision of the majority
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.154" href="#BD.3.154"></a>
;</li>
<li> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.6" href="#Bu-As.6"></a>

<li> <a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-As.7" href="#Bu-As.7"></a>
The covering up (as) with grass.</li>
</ol>

<p>Recited, venerable ones, are the seven rules for the deciding of legal
questions. Concerning them, I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are quite
pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in
this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this
matter? The venerable ones are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are
silent. Thus do I understand this.</p>
<h2>Monks’ Conclusion</h2>
<p>Recited, venerable ones, is the occasion, recited are the four rules for
offences involving defeat, recited are the thirteen rules for offences
entailing a formal meeting of the Order, recited are the thirty rules for
offences of expiation involving forfeiture, recited are the ninety-two rules
for offences of expiation, recited are the four rules for offences which ought
to be confessed, recited are the rules for training, recited are the seven
rules for the deciding of legal questions. So much (of the sayings) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.155" href="#BD.3.155"></a>
of the lord, handed down in clauses, contained in clauses, comes up for
recitation every half month. All should train therein in harmony, on friendly
terms, without contention.</p>
