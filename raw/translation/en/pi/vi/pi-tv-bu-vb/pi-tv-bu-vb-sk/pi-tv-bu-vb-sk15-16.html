at that time the group of six monks, their bodies swaying, went (sat down)
amidst the houses, bending their bodies … “…</p>
<p>‘Not swaying the body will I go (sit down) amidst the houses,’ is a training to
be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not go (sit down) amidst the houses swaying the body. One should go
(sit down) holding the body straight. Whoever out of disrespect, the body
swaying, goes (sits down) amidst the houses bending the body, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill <span class="add"><em>in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-sk15-16#Bu-Sk.16">Bu-Sk.16</a>
