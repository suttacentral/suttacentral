… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, their
arms swaying, went (sat down) amidst the houses, bending their arms … “…</p>
<p>‘Not swaying the arms will I go (sit down) amidst the houses,’ is a training to
be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not go (sit down) amidst the houses swaying the arms. One should go
(sit down) holding the arms straight. Whoever out of disrespect, the arms
swaying, goes (sits down) amidst the houses bending the arms, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.125" href="#BD.3.125"></a>
There is no offence …
