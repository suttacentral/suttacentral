… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having
uncovered their bodies, went amidst the houses <span class="add">
<em>instead of</em> went

<p>‘Properly clad will I go (sit down) amidst the houses,’ is a training to be
observed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.122" href="#BD.3.122"></a>

disrespect, having uncovered the body, goes (sits down) amidst the houses,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill <span class="add"><em>in <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-sk3-4#Bu-Sk.4">Bu-Sk.4</a>
it is added here</em>: if he has gone into residence for the rains, if there are accidents, if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</span></p>
