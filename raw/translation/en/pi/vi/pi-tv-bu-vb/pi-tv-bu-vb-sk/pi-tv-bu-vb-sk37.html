… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having
asked for curry and conjey for themselves, ate it. People looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks, having
asked for curry and conjey for themselves, eat it? Who does not like
well-cooked things? Who does not like sweet things?” Monks heard these people
who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, having asked for curry and conjey for
themselves, eat it?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, having asked for curry and conjey for
yourselves, ate it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men … eat it? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those
who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not eat curry or conjey, having asked for it for myself,’ is a training
to be observed.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.132" href="#BD.3.132"></a>
Now at that time monks came to be ill. Monks, asking after the ill ones, spoke
thus to the ill monks: “We hope that your reverences are better, we hope that
you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Formerly we, your reverences, having asked for curry or conjey for ourselves,
ate it; thus there came to be comfort for us. But now it is forbidden by the
lord, and being scrupulous, we do not ask; thus there comes to be no comfort
for us.” They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, having asked for curry or conjey for
himself, to eat it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>‘I will not eat curry or conjey, having asked for it for myself, if not ill,’
is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One should not eat curry or conjey, having asked for it for oneself, unless one
is ill. Whoever out of disrespect, having asked for curry or conjey for
oneself, if not ill, eats it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if it belongs to relations, if it is offered, if it is
by means of his own property, if there are accidents, if he is mad, if he is
the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.194" href="#Vin.4.194"></a>
