… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having
chosen here and there, ate almsfood … “…</p>
<p>‘On continuous alms-tour will I eat almsfood,’ is a training to be observed.”</p>
<p>One should eat almsfood on continuous alms-tour. Whoever out of disrespect eats
almsfood, having chosen, here and there, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional, if he is not thinking, if he does
not know, if he is ill, if giving to others he is impatient, if piling up
(food) into another’s vessel he is impatient, if there are dainties, if there
are accidents, if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.192" href="#Vin.4.192"></a>
