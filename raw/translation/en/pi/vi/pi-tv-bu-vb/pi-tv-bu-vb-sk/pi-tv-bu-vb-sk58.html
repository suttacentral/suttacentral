… in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks taught
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) with a staff in his hand … “…</p>
<p>‘I will not teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who is not ill (and) who has a staff in his hand,’ is a training
to be observed.”</p>
<p><span class="term">Staff</span> means:
<span class="gloss">(the size of) four hands of a man of average height. Bigger than that it is not
a staff, smaller it is not a staff.</span></p>
<p>Dhamma should not be taught to (someone) who has a staff in his hand (and) who
is not ill. Whoever out of disrespect teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to (someone) who has a staff in his hand (and) who is not ill, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional … if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
