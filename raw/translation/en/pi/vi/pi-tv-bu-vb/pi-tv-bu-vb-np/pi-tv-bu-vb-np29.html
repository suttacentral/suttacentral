<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>29. The training rule on what is risky</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.29.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.29.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.156"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2400"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time monks who had completed the rains residence were staying in wilderness dwellings. Thieves who were active during the month of Kattika attacked the monks, thinking, “They have obtained things.”</p>
<p>The monks informed the Master. Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow monks who are staying in wilderness dwellings to store one of their three robes in an inhabited area.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.263"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.29.1.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2401"></a> Knowing that the Master had made this allowance, monks stored one of their three robes in inhabited areas, and they stayed apart from them for more than six days. The robes were lost, destroyed, burnt, and eaten by rats. As a consequence those monks became poorly dressed. Other monks asked them why, and they informed them of what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can those monks store one of their three robes in an inhabited area and then stay apart from it for more than six days?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2402"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.157"></a> “Is it true, monks, that some monks are doing this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them: “… Monks, how can those foolish men store one of their three robes in an inhabited area and then stay apart from it for more than six days? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2403"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. After observing the Kattika full moon that ends the rainy season, a monk who is staying in such a dwelling may store one of his three robes in an inhabited area, if he so desires, so long as he has a reason for staying apart from that robe. He should stay apart from that robe for six days at the most. If he stays apart from it beyond that, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>
