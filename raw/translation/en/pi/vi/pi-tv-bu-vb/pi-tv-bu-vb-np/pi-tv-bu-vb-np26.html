<p>Monks’ Relinquishment</p>
<h1>26. The training rule on asking for thread</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.256"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.26.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.142"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2350"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.<span class="note" hidden>From the origin story to <i lang="pi">pācittiya</i> 32 it seems <i lang="pi">cīvarakārasamaya</i> refers to any time one is making a robe, see <span class="ref">MS.2.729</span>.</span> At that time monks from the group of six were making robes, and they asked for a large amount of thread. Yet even when their robes had been sewn, there was much thread left over. They said, “Well, let’s ask for more thread and get weavers to weave us robe-cloth.” Yet even when the robe-cloth had been woven, there was much thread left over. For a second time they asked for more thread and got weavers to weave them robe-cloth. Once again there was much thread left over. For a third time they asked for more thread and got weavers to weave them robe-cloth. People grumbled and complained, “How can the Sakyan ascetics ask for thread and then get weavers to weave them robe-cloth?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2351"></a> Monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks from the group of six ask for thread and then get weavers to weave them robe-cloth?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2352"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “…<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.143"></a> Foolish men, how can you ask for thread and then get weavers to weave you robe-cloth? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2353"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk himself asks for thread, and then gets weavers to weave him robe-cloth, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”</strong> </p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-np.26.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2354"></a><strong class="term"> A:</strong><span class="gloss"> whoever …</span><strong class="term"> Monk:</strong><span class="gloss"> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a complete Order through a formal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is unchallengeable and fit to stand— this sort of monk is meant in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2355"></a><strong class="term"> Himself:</strong><span class="gloss"> he himself has asked.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2356"></a><strong class="term"> Thread:</strong><span class="gloss"> there are six kinds of thread: linen, cotton, silk, wool, jute, and hemp.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.257"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2357"></a><strong class="term"> Weavers:</strong><span class="gloss"> for every action to get it woven by weavers, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.2.144"></a> When he gets the robe-cloth, it becomes subject to relinquishment.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>The robe-cloth should be relinquished to an Order, a group, or an individual.<span class="kamma"> “And, monks, it should be relinquished in this way. …<span class="add"> To be expanded as in <a href="/en/pi-tv-bu-vb-np1#13">Relinquishment 1, paragraphs 13–17</a>, with appropriate substitutions. …</span> ‘Venerables, this robe-cloth which I got woven by weavers after asking for the thread myself is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Order.’ … the Order should give … you should give … ‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”</span></p>
<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2358"></a> If he got it woven, and he perceives that he did, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If he got it woven, but he is unsure if he did, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If he got it woven, but he perceives that he did not, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2359"></a> If he did not get it woven, but he perceives that he did, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he did not get it woven, but he is unsure if he did, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If he did not get it woven, and he perceives that he did not, there is no offense.</p>
<h2>Non-offenses</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="2360"></a> There is no offense: if it is to sew a robe; if it is for a bandage; if it is for a waistband; if it is for a shoulder-strap; if it is for a bowl-bag; if it is for a water-strainer; if it is from relatives; if it is from those who have given an invitation; if it for the benefit of someone else; if it is by means of one’s own property; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>
