<p>Monks’ Expulsion</p>
<h1>2. The second training rule</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.2"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.2.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.64"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.41"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.191"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rains there. Among them was Venerable Dhaniya, the potter’s son. After three months, when the rains residence was over, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and wood, and departed to wander around the country. But Venerable Dhaniya also spent the winter and the summer there.</p>
<p>Then, on one occasion, while Venerable Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, and again the hut was demolished in the same way. The same thing happened a third time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.192"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.65"></a> Dhaniya thought, “Three times this has happened. But I’m well-trained and experienced in my own craft of pottery. Why don’t I knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of nothing but clay?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.193"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.42"></a> Then Dhaniya did just that. And he collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. It was a beautiful and charming little hut, and it was red just like a scarlet rain-mite. And when hit it sounded just like the sound of a bell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.194"></a> Just then the Master, while descending from Mount Vulture Peak with a number of monks, saw that hut. He said to the monks, “Monks, what’s this beautiful and charming thing, which is red like a scarlet rain-mite?” The monks informed the Master, and the Buddha criticized Dhaniya:</p>
<p>“It’s not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can he make a hut out of nothing but clay? Certainly that foolish man can have no consideration, compassion, and mercy for living beings.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.66"></a> Go, monks, and demolish this hut. Don’t let future generations take up the destruction of living beings.<strong class="rule"> And, monks, you should not make a hut consisting of nothing but clay. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”</strong></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.67"></a> “Yes, Venerable,” the monks replied, and they went to that hut an demolished it.</p>
<p>Dhaniya said to them, “Why are you demolishing my hut?”</p>
<p>“The Master has asked us to.”</p>
<p>“Demolish it, if the Lord of the Truth has said so.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.195"></a> Then Dhaniya thought, “Three times, while I was in the village to collect almsfood, women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks. And now my hut made of nothing but clay has been demolished at the Master’s request. But the caretaker of the wood-store is a friend of mine. Why don’t I ask him for wood and make a hut out of that?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.196"></a> Dhaniya then went to the caretaker of the wood-store and told him what had happened, adding: “Please give me some wood, I want to make a wooden hut.”</p>
<p>“There’s no such wood, Venerable, that I could give you.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.43"></a> This wood is held by the King, and it’s meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergencies. You can only take it if the King gives it away.”</p>
<p>“It’s been given by the King.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.197"></a> The caretaker of the wood-store thought, “These Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth. They are celibate and their conduct is good, and they are truthful, moral, and have a good character. Even the King has faith in them. These venerables wouldn’t say something is given if it were not.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.68"></a> And he said to Dhaniya, “You may take it, Venerable.” Dhaniya then had that wood broken up into pieces, removed it by means of carts, and made a wooden hut.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.198"></a> Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, while inspecting the works in Rājagaha, went to the caretaker of the wood-store and said to him: “What’s going on? Where’s the wood held by the King that’s meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergencies?”</p>
<p>“Sir, that wood was given by the King to Venerable Dhaniya.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.199"></a> The brahmin Vassakāra was upset and thought, “How could the King give away this wood to Dhaniya, the potter’s son?”</p>
<p>The brahmin Vassakāra then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said, “Is it true, sir, that the wood held by the King, meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergencies was given by the King to Dhaniya, the potter’s son?”</p>
<p>“Who said that?”</p>
<p>“The caretaker of the wood-store, sir.”</p>
<p>“Well then, brahmin, send for the caretaker of the wood-store.” And Vassakāra had the caretaker of the wood-store bound and taken by force.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.200"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.69"></a> Dhaniya saw the caretaker of the wood-store being bound and taken by force, and he said to him, “Why is this happening to you?”</p>
<p>“Because of that business with the wood, Venerable.”</p>
<p>“Go, and I’ll come too.”</p>
<p>“Please come before I’m done for.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.201"></a> Dhaniya then went to the dwelling of King Bimbisāra and sat down on the appointed seat.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.44"></a> The King approached Dhaniya, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. He then said, “Is it true, Venerable, that I have given the wood held by the King—meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergencies—to you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, great king.”</p>
<p>“We kings are very busy— we may give and not remember. Please remind me, Venerable.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these words: ‘Let the ascetics and brahmins enjoy gifts of grass, sticks, and water’?”</p>
<p>“I remember, Venerable. There are ascetics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and desirous of training. They have a sense of conscience even in regard to small matters. What was uttered by me was meant for these, and it concerned what’s ownerless in the wilderness. Yet you, Venerable, imagine that you can take wood not given to you by means of this trick?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.70"></a> But how could I presume to beat, imprison, or banish an ascetic or a brahmin living in my kingdom? Go, you’re free because of your status, but don’t do such a thing again.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.202"></a> But people grumbled and complained: “These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin; they’ve lost the plot. They even deceive the King—what then other people?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.203"></a> Monks heard the complaints of those people. The monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and desirous of training, complained and criticized Venerable Dhaniya: “How can he take wood belonging to the King that hasn’t been given to him?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.204"></a> After criticizing Dhaniya in many ways, they informed the Master. The Master then convened the Order of monks and questioned Venerable Dhaniya: “Is it true, Dhaniya, that you’ve taken wood belonging to the King that wasn’t given to you?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.71"></a> The Buddha rebuked him: “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.45"></a> How can you take wood belonging to the King that hasn’t been given to you? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.205"></a> At that time a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the Master. The Master said to him, “For what amount of theft does King Bimbisāra beat, imprison, or banish a thief?”</p>
<p>“For a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> coin, Master, for the worth of a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, or for more than a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.72"></a> At that time in Rājagaha a <i lang="pi">pāda</i> coin was worth five <i lang="pi">māsaka</i> coins.</p>
<p>After criticizing Venerable Dhaniya in many ways for being difficult to support … “… And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.206"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk, intending to steal, takes what has not been given to him— the sort of theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”— he too is expelled and not in communion.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.207"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.2.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.208"></a><span class="note" hidden>The text simply says “the dyers’ spread,” <i lang="pi">rajakattharaṇaṃ</i>, but the commentary qualifies that this refers to their spread of “cloth,” <i lang="pi">vatthāni</i>, see <span class="ref">Sp.2.298.17</span>.</span> At one time monks from the group of six went to the dyers’ spread of cloth, took the dyers’ goods to the monastery, and shared it out. Other monks said, “You have great merit,<span class="note" hidden>In addition to meaning a finished robe, according to the definition of <i lang="pi">cīvara</i> at <i lang="pi">nissaggiya pācittiya</i> 1 <span class="ref">MS.1.1872</span>, it also refers to pieces of robe-cloth. This means that I vary my translation depending on the context. Sometimes, such as here, the meaning seems to encompass both robes and robe-cloth, and I then render it as robe(-cloth).</span> since you’ve obtained so much robe(-cloth).”</p>
<p>“How is there merit for us? Just now we went to the dyers’ spread of cloth and took the dyers’ goods.”</p>
<p>“Hasn’t a training rule been laid down by the Master? Why then do you take the dyers’ goods?”</p>
<p>“It’s true that a training rule has been laid down by the Master, but it concerns the village, not the wilderness.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just the same.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.73"></a> It’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you take the dyers’s goods? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.46"></a> After criticizing those monks in various ways, they informed the Master.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.209"></a> The Master convened the Order of monks and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you went to the dyers’ spread of cloth and took the dyers’ goods?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you go to the dyers’ spread of cloth and take the dyers’ goods? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.” Then, after criticizing those monks from the group of six in various ways, the Master spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … but he spoke in praise … of putting forth energy. Having given a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks … “… And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
