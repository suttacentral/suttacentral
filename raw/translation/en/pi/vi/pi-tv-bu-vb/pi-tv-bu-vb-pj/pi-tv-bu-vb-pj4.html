<p>Monks’ Expulsion</p>
<h1>4. The fourth training rule</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.4.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.151"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.87"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.534"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rains residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. Just then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to get by on almsfood.</p>
<p>The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains, and get almsfood without problems?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.535"></a> Some said, “We could work for the householders, and they’ll give something in return. In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.536"></a> Some said, “There’s no need to work for the householders.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.152"></a> Let’s instead take messages for them, and they’ll give something in return. In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.537"></a> Some said, “There’s no need to work for the householders, nor to take messages for them. Let’s instead praise one another’s super-human qualities to the householders: ‘Such a monk has the first absorption, such a monk the second absorption, such a monk the third, such a monk the fourth; such a monk is a stream-enterer, such a monk a once-returner, such a non-returner, such a perfected one; such a monk has the three true insights, and such the six higher knowledges.’ Then they’ll give to us.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.88"></a> In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood. Indeed, this is the better way, that we praise one another’s super-human qualities to the householders.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.538"></a> Then those monks praised one another’s super-human qualities to the householders: “Such a monk has the first absorption … such a monk has the six higher knowledges.” And those people thought, “We’re fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rains residence.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.153"></a> Such monks as these, who are virtuous and of good character, have never before entered the rains residence with us.” And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. In this way those monks were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.539"></a> Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains residence to go to see the Master. So when the rainy-season residence was completed and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their lodgings in order, took their bowls and robes, and departed for Vesālī. When they eventually arrived at Vesālī, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Master, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.540"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.154"></a> At that time the monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in that region were thin, haggard, and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs. But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear skin. It is the custom for Buddhas to greet visiting monks, and so the Master said to them, “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable; I hope you spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>“We’re keeping well, Master, we’re comfortable; we spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.”<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.89"></a> Buddhas sometimes ask knowing, and knowing sometimes do not ask; they ask knowing the right time to ask, and they ask knowing the right time not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial; in regard to what is unbeneficial, the Buddhas have destroyed the bridge. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.541"></a> And the Master said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you spend the rains at ease, without having any trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>Then those monks informed the Master.</p>
<p>“But had you really achieved those super-human qualities?”</p>
<p>“No, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.155"></a> “It’s unsuitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not fitting for an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s super-human qualities to householders? It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to praise one another’s super-human qualities to householders. Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience death-like suffering, but you wouldn’t because of that be reborn in a bad destination. But for <em>this</em> reason you might. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” … After criticizing them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks:</p>
<div class="parallel">
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.1.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.542"></a> “Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world. What five? A great gangster thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, wander among villages, towns, and royal capitals, killing and making others kill, destroying and making others destroy, tormenting and making others torment?’ Then after some time, he does just that. Just so, monks, a bad monk thinks like this: ‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, go wandering among villages, towns, and royal capitals;<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.156"></a> be honored, respected, and revered by both householders and those gone forth; and obtain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines?’<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.90"></a> Then after some time, he does just that. This is the first great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.543"></a> Again, a bad monk learns the Teaching and training proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his own. This is the second great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.544"></a> Again, a bad monk groundlessly accuses someone who lives the spiritual life in purity of not abstaining from sexuality. This is the third great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.545"></a> Again, a bad monk takes valuable goods and equipment belonging to the monastic Order—<span class="note" hidden>I have rendered <i lang="pi">muñja</i>-reed and <i lang="pi">pabbaja</i>-reed with the single word “reed.” I am not aware that these two types of reed can be distinguished in English.</span>a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the land of a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a cushion, a pillow, a metal vessel, a metal jar, a metal pot, a metal receptacle, an adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden articles, earthenware articles— and uses them to win over and create a following among householders. This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.157"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.546"></a> But in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this is the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a super-human quality. Why is that? Monks, you’ve eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.547"></a> Whoever should declare himself<br>to be other than he truly is,<br>Has eaten this by theft,<br>like a cheater who has deceived.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.548"></a> Many ocher-necks of bad qualities,<br>uncontrolled and wicked—<br>By their wicked deeds,<br>they are reborn in hell.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.549"></a> It is better to eat an iron ball,<br>heated, like a burning flame,<br>Than for the immoral and uncontrolled<br>to eat the country’s alms.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.550"></a> After criticizing the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in various ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … “… And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.551"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.158"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human quality, knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offense and desiring purification—should say:<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.91"></a> “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” he too is expelled and not in communion.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsutta"><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.552"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.4.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.553"></a> At one time a number of monks, thinking they had seen what they had not, attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realized what they had not, declared final knowledge because of overestimation. After some time, their minds inclined to sensual desire, ill-will, and confusion. They became remorseful, thinking, “The Master has laid down a training rule; yet we declared final knowledge because of overestimation. Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion?” They informed Venerable Ānanda, who informed the Master.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.159"></a> He said, “Ānanda, these monks declared final knowledge because of overestimation, thinking they had seen what they had not, attained what they had not, achieved what they had not, realized what they had not, but this is negligible.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.554"></a> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.555"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a super-human quality, knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” but after some time—whether he is questioned or not, but having committed the offense and desiring purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” unless it is due to overestimation, he too is expelled and not in communion.’”</strong> </p>

<p>“Monks, there is such a stillness, but it’s not wholly purified. Moggallāna spoke truthfully. There’s no offense for Moggallāna.”</p>

If a monk commits any one of them, he is no longer in communion with the monks. As before, so after, he’s expelled and not in communion. In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”</p>
