<p>Monks’ Expulsion</p>
<h1>3. The third training rule</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.3"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pj.3.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.116"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.68"></a> <a class="ms-pa" id="ms.376"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time the Master spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractiveness— he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, in praise of developing the mind in unattractiveness, and in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.377"></a> The Master then addressed the monks: “Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. No-one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Venerable Sir,” they replied, and no-one approached him except the one who brought him almsfood.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.378"></a> The monks thought, “The Master has talked in many ways about unattractiveness,” and they devoted themselves to the development of the mind in unattractiveness in its many different aspects. As a consequence, they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, disgusted with them.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.117"></a> Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, who had just washed her hair—would be ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog, or a man were hung around her neck, just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies. They took their own lives, took the lives of one another, and they approached Migalaṇḍika, the ascetic lookalike, and said, “Please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.118"></a> And hired for a bowl and robe, Migalaṇḍika killed many monks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.379"></a> He took his blood-stained knife to the river Vaggumudā, and while he was washing it, he became anxious and remorseful: “This is truly bad for me;<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.69"></a> I’ve made much demerit by killing virtuous monks.”</p>
<p>Then, walking across the water, a god from the realm of the lord of death said to Migalaṇḍika, “Well done, superior man, you’re truly fortunate. You’ve made much merit, because you’ve brought across those who hadn’t yet crossed.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.119"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.380"></a> And Migalaṇḍika thought, “So it seems that I’m fortunate and that I’ve made much merit.” He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, and said, “Who hasn’t crossed yet? Whom do I bring across?” The monks who still had sensual desire became fearful and terrified, with their hair standing on end. Only those who were free from desires were unaffected.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.381"></a> Then, on a single day, Migalaṇḍika killed one monk, two monks, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, even sixty monks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.382"></a> At the end of that half-month, the Master came out of seclusion and said to Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why is the Order of monks so diminished?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.120"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.70"></a> Ānanda told him what had happened and added, “Venerable Sir, please give another instruction so that the Order of monks may become established in final knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Ānanda, bring together in the assembly-hall all the monks who live near Vesālī.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.121"></a> “Yes.” When he had done so, he approached the Master and said, “Venerable Sir, the Order of monks is assembled. Please do as you think is appropriate.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.383"></a> The Master then went to the assembly-hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the monks:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.384"></a> “Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of bliss. And it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. Just as a great, unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season stops and settles the dust and dirt in the air, just so, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.385"></a> And how is stillness by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in this way?</p>
<div class="parallel">
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.122"></a> A monk sits down in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut." He crosses his legs, straightens his body, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. Simply mindful, he breathes in; simply mindful, he breathes out.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.386"></a> When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows that. When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short, he knows that.<span class="note" hidden>I have here translated <i lang="pi">kāya</i> as breath in accordance with the usage in the Ānāpānasati Sutta <span class="ref">MN 118.24</span> where the breath is specifically said to be a body among bodies. This is also the commentarial explanation: “He trains, ‘I will breath in,’ producing knowledge of and familiarity with the beginning, the middle, and the end of the whole body of the breath.” (<i lang="pi">Sakalassa assāsakāyassa ādimajjhapariyosānaṃ viditaṃ karonto pākaṭaṃ karonto “assasissāmī”ti sikkhati</i>; <span class="ref">Sp.2.411.2</span>.)</span> When breathing in, he trains in having the full experience of the breath;<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.71"></a> when breathing out, he trains in having the full experience of the breath. When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.387"></a> When breathing in, he trains in experiencing joy; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing joy. When breathing in, he trains in experiencing bliss; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing bliss. When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind.</p>
<p>When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the mind. When breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; when breathing out, he trains in gladdening the mind. When breathing in, he trains in stilling the mind; when breathing out, he trains in stilling the mind. When breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in freeing the mind.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.388"></a> When breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. When breathing in, he trains in contemplating fading away; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating fading away. When breathing in, he trains in contemplating cessation; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating cessation. When breathing in, he trains in contemplating relinquishment; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating relinquishment.</p>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.389"></a> Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of bliss, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.390"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.123"></a> The Master then had the Order of monks assembled and asked them: “Is it true, monks, that some monks have taken their own lives, have killed one another, and have said to Migalaṇḍika, ‘Please kill us; this bowl and robe will be yours’?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them: “Monks, it’s not suitable for these monks, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. How could those monks take their own lives, kill one another, and say to Migalaṇḍika, ‘Please kill us; this bowl and robe will be yours’? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.391"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him, he too is expelled and not in communion.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.392"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pj.3.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.393"></a> At one time a lay follower was sick. He had a beautiful and pleasant wife, and monks from the group of six had fallen in love with her.<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.72"></a> They said to each other, “If this lay follower lives, we won’t get this woman. Come, let’s praise death to him.”</p>
<p>They then went to that lay follower and said, “You’ve done what’s good and wholesome;<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.124"></a> you’ve made a shelter against fear. You haven’t done anything bad: you haven’t been greedy or immoral. What’s the point of this wretched and difficult life? Death is better for you than life. When you have passed away, you’ll be reborn in a happy place, in heaven. There you’ll be able to enjoy the five kinds of heavenly sense pleasure.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.394"></a> That lay follower thought, “The Venerables have spoken the truth, for I’ve done what’s good and avoided what’s bad, and after death I’ll be reborn in a happy place.”</p>
<p>From then on he ate various kinds of detrimental food and drank detrimental drinks, and as a consequence, he became seriously ill and died.</p>
<p>But his wife complained and criticized those monks:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.125"></a> “These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin; they’ve lost the plot. They praised death to my husband, and because of them my husband has died.”</p>
<p>And other people complained and criticized them in the same way.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.395"></a> The monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and desirous of training, complained and criticized those monks: “How could they praise death to that lay follower?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms.396"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.73"></a> After criticizing those monks in various ways, they informed the Master …</p>
<p>“Is it true, monks, that you praised death to that lay follower?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. How could you praise death to that lay follower? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
