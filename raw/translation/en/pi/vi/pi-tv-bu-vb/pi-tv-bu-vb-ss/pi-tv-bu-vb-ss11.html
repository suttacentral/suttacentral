<p>Monks’ Suspension</p>
<h1>11. The training rule on supporting a schism</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.175"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.304"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.11.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1704"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time Devadatta was pursuing schism in the monastic Order, a break in transmission. The monks were saying, “Devadatta doesn’t speak in accordance with the Teaching or the training. How can he pursue schism in the monastic Order?”</p>
<p>But Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta said to those monks, “Venerables, don’t say that. Devadatta does speak in accordance with the Teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can these monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the monastic Order?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1705"></a> They rebuked those monks in many ways and then informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, monks, that some monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Order?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.305"></a> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them: “… Monks, how can those foolish men support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Order? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1706"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘That monk may have one, two, or three monks who take his side and support him, and they may say, “Venerables, don’t correct this monk. He speaks in accordance with the Teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.” The monks should say to those monks, “Venerables, don’t say that. This monk does not speak in accordance with the Teaching or the training. Don’t consent to schism in the monastic Order. Stay with the Order, for a united Order—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.” If those monks still continue as before, the monks should admonish them up to three times to make them stop. If they then stop, that is good. If not, they incur an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>

<p><strong class="term"> Should admonish them:</strong></p>
<div class="gloss">
<p>“And, monks, they should be admonished in this way. A competent and capable monk should inform the Order:</p>
<div class="kamma">
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1715"></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me. Monks so-and-so and so-and-so are taking sides with and supporting monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the monastic Order. They are not stopping that activity. If it seems appropriate to the Order, the Order should admonish them to make them stop. This is the motion.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1716"></a> Venerables, let the Order listen to me. Monks so-and-so and so-and-so are taking sides with and supporting monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the monastic Order. They are not stopping that activity. The Order admonishes them to make them stop. Any monk who approves of admonishing them to make them stop should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should say so.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1717"></a> A second time … A third time I speak on this matter: Venerables, let the Order listen to me. Monks so-and-so and so-and-so are taking sides with and supporting monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the monastic Order. They are not stopping that activity. The Order admonishes them to make them stop.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.307"></a> Any monk who approves of admonishing them to make them stop should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should say so.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1718"></a> The monks so-and-so and so-and-so have been admonished by the Order to make them stop that activity. The Order approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1719"></a> After the motion, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. After each of the first two announcements, they commit a serious offense. When the last announcement is finished, they commit an offense entailing suspension. For those who commit the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. Two or three can be admonished together, but not more than that.</p>

<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1720"></a><strong class="term"> They incur an offense entailing suspension:</strong><span class="gloss"> … Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension.”</span></p>
