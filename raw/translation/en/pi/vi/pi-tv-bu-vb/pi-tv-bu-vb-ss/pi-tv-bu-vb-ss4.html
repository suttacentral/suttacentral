<p>Monks’ Suspension</p>
<h1>4. The training rule on fulfilling one’s own desires</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.132"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.222"></a><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="bu-ss.4.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.4.1.1"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1180"></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. Then, after dressing one morning, Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to the house of a beautiful widow, where he sat down on the prepared seat. That woman approached Udāyī, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. Udāyī then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. And she said, “Venerable, please say what you need. I’m able to give robes, almsfood, dwelling equipment, and medicines.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1181"></a> “It’s not hard for us, Sister, to get those requisites. Give instead what’s hard for us to get.”</p>
<p>“What’s that, Venerable?”</p>
<p>“Sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p>“Is it wanted now, Venerable?”</p>
<p>“It is, Sister.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.223"></a> “Come, Venerable,” and she entered her bedroom, took off her clothes, and lay back on the bed. Udāyī approached her and spat out, “Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch!” and he departed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1182"></a> That woman then complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan recluses are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character. But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin; they’ve lost the plot. How can the ascetic Udāyī request sexual intercourse from me, but then spit out, ‘Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch!’ and depart? What’s bad about me? How am I foul-smelling? In what way am I inferior to whom?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1183"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.4.1.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1184"></a> Other women, too, criticized him in the same way,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a> and the monks heard them. The monks of few desires …<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.224"></a> complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī commend the fulfilling of his own desires in the presence of a woman?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi3.133"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1185"></a> Those monks rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then informed the Master. The Master had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Udāyī, “Is it true, Udāyī, that you commended the fulfilling of your own desires in the presence of a woman?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a recluse, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you commend the fulfilling of your own desires in the presence of a woman? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fevers of sense desire? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1186"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a lustful monk encourages a woman to satisfy his own needs:<a class="pts-vp-en" id="bd.1.225"></a> “Sister, she provides the highest service who in this way satisfies one like me, who is virtuous, celibate, and of good character,” and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</strong> </p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="bu-ss.4.2"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1187"></a><strong class="term"> A:</strong><span class="gloss"> whoever …</span><strong class="term"> Monk:</strong><span class="gloss"> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a complete Order through a formal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is unchallengeable and fit to stand— this sort of monk is meant in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="ms-pa" id="ms-pa1188"></a><strong class="term"> Lustful:</strong><span class="note" hidden>I have rendered <i lang="pi">otiṇṇo vipariṇatena cittena</i> with the single word “lustful.” This means that the definition for <i lang="pi">vipariṇataṃ</i> is missing from my translation. Here is the Pali, followed by a translation: <i lang="pi">Vipariṇatanti rattampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Duṭṭhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Mūḷhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Api ca rattaṃ cittaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippetaṃ vipariṇatanti</i>; “distorted: a mind with desire is distorted, a mind with anger is distorted, a confused mind is distorted. But in this case ‘distorted’ refers to a mind with desire.”</span><span class="gloss"> having lust, longing for, in love with.</span></p>
