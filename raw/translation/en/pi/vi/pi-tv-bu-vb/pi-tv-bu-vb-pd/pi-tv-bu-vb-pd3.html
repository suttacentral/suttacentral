… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
there was in Sāvatthī a certain family which on both sides came to be pleased,
it grew in faith, it decreased in wealth; whatever solid food or soft food
accrued to that family before a meal, having given it all away to monks,
sometimes they went without food. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation, accept?
These (people), having given to these (monks), sometimes go without food.”
Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this
matter to the lord. Then the lord on this <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.179" href="#Vin.4.179"></a>
occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a family is growing in faith, is decreasing in
wealth, to give such a family an agreement as to learners by a (formal) act at
which the motion is followed by one proclamation. And thus, monks, should it be
given: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:
<span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Such and such a family is growing
in faith, is decreasing in wealth. If it seems right to the Order, let the
Order give the agreement as to learners to such and such a family. This is the
motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. Such and such a family … in
wealth. The Order <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.111" href="#BD.3.111"></a>
gives the agreement as to learners to such and such a family. If the giving of
the agreement as to learners to such and such a family is pleasing to the
venerable ones, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing, they should speak.
The agreement as to learners is given by the Order to such and such a family,
and it is right … So do I understand this.’</span> And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners, whatever monk
having accepted among such families as are agreed upon as learners solid food
or soft food with his own hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be
confessed by that monk, saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a
blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.3.2.1" href="#Bu-Pd.3.2.1"></a>
Now at that time there came to be a festival at Sāvatthī. People, having
invited monks, offered them food. The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent,
thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord, having accepted among families that are
agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with one’s own hand, to eat it,
to partake of it.” These looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:
“But how is it that because of our way of living, the masters do not accept
from us?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told
this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection,
having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when invited, having accepted among families agreed upon
as learners solid food or soft food with your own hand, to eat it, to partake
of it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
“Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners, whatever monk if
he is not invited beforehand, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.180" href="#Vin.4.180"></a>
having accepted among such families as are agreed upon as learners solid food
or soft food with his <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.112" href="#BD.3.112"></a>
own hand, should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk,
saying: ‘I have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming,
which ought to be confessed; I confess it.’” <p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pd.3.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.3.3.1" href="#Bu-Pd.3.3.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk came to frequent that family. Then that monk,
having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached that
family, and having approached he sat down on the appointed seat. At that time
this monk came to be ill. Then these people spoke thus to this monk: “Eat,
honoured sir.” Then that monk, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord, not
being invited, having accepted among families agreed upon as learners solid
food or soft food with one’s own hand, to eat it, to partake of it,” and being
scrupulous, he did not accept; he was not able to walk for alms, he became
famished. Then that monk, having gone to the monastery, told this matter to the
monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion,
in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, having accepted among families agreed
upon as learners solid food or soft food with his own hand, to eat it, to
partake of it. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
“<span class="rule">Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners, whatever monk, if
he is not invited beforehand (and) not ill, having accepted among such families
as are agreed upon as learners solid food or soft food with his own hand,
should eat it or partake of it, it should be confessed by that monk, saying:
‘Your reverences, I have fallen into a blameworthy matter, unbecoming, which
ought to be confessed; I confess it.’</span>”

<span class="term">Whatever are those families that are agreed upon as learners</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a family agreed upon as learners is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.113" href="#BD.3.113"></a>
called that family which is growing in faith, decreasing in wealth; for such a
family an agreement as to learners comes to be given by a (formal) act at which
the motion is followed by one proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Among such families as are agreed, upon as learners</span> means:
<span class="gloss">among families like these agreed upon as learners.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not invited</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not invited for today or tomorrow. If he invites him as he is entering the
precincts of the house, this means not invited. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.181" href="#Vin.4.181"></a>
Invited means: invited for today or tomorrow. If he invites him not as he is
entering the precincts of the house, this means invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he is able to walk for alms. Ill means: he is not able to walk for alms.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Solid food</span> means:

<p>If he is not invited, not ill, (and) accepts, thinking: “I will eat, I will
partake of,” there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an
offence which ought to be confessed.</p>

learners … If he thinks that they are not agreed upon as learners when they are

for the sake of nutriment (food that may be eaten) during a watch of the night,
during seven days, during life, there is an <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.114" href="#BD.3.114"></a>
offence of wrong-doing. For every mouthful there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that they are agreed upon as learners when they are not agreed

whether they are not agreed upon as learners, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that they are not agreed upon as learners when they
are not agreed upon as learners, there is no offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.3.4.3" href="#Bu-Pd.3.4.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is invited; if he is ill; if he eats the remainder
