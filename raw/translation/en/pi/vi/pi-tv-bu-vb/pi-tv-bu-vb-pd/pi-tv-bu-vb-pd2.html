… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrel’s feeding-place. Now at that
time monks ate, invited by families. The group of six nuns came to be standing,
giving directions for the group of six monks, saying: “Here give curry, give
cooked rice here.” The group of six monks ate as much as they pleased, other
monks did not eat as much as expected. Those who were modest monks … spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, when the nuns are giving directions, not
restrain (them)?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, when nuns were giving directions, did
not restrain (them)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men
… not restrain (them)? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Now, monks eat, invited by families. If a nun comes to be standing as though
giving directions, saying: ‘Here give curry, give cooked rice here,’ that nun
should be rebuked by those monks, saying: ‘Stand aside, sister, while the monks
eat.’ But if it should not occur to a single monk to dismiss that nun, saying:
‘Stand aside, sister, while the monks eat,’ it should be confessed by those
monks, saying: ‘We have fallen, your reverences, into a blameworthy matter,
unbecoming, which ought to be confessed; we confess it.’”</span></p>

<span class="term">Now monks eat, invited by families</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a family means there are four (kinds of) family: noble family, brahmin family,
merchant family, low-class family.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.108" href="#BD.3.108"></a>
<span class="term">Eat, invited</span>, means:
<span class="gloss">they eat, invited to any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.178" href="#Vin.4.178"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Giving directions</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if according to friendship, according to comradeship, according to intimacy,
according as one has the same preceptor, according as one has the same teacher,
she says: ‘Here give curry, give cooked rice here,’ this means giving
directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">By those monks</span> means:
<span class="gloss">by the monks who are eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the nun who is giving directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That nun should be dismissed by those monks, saying: ‘Stand aside, sister,
while the monks eat.’</span> But if she is not dismissed by a single monk (and) he accepts (food), saying:
‘I will eat, I will partake of,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. For every
mouthful there is an offence which ought to be confessed.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.2.2.2" href="#Bu-Pd.2.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) does not restrain
her when she is giving directions, there is an offence which ought to be
confessed. If he is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If he thinks that
she is not ordained when she is ordained … offence which ought to be confessed.
If he does not restrain one ordained by one (Order only) who is giving
directions, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that she is
ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is
in doubt as to whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pd.2.2.3" href="#Bu-Pd.2.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she makes (another) give her own meal, (but) does not
(herself) give; if she gives a meal to others (but) does not make (them) give;
if she makes (another) give what was not given; if she makes (another) give
where it was not given; if she makes (another) give the same to everybody; if a
female <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.109" href="#BD.3.109"></a>
probationer gives directions; if a female novice gives directions; setting
aside the five (kinds of) meals, there is no offence in (eating) any others; if
he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
