… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, having arranged together with nuns, were going along
the same high-road. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“Just as we tour with our wives, so do these recluses, sons of the Sakyans,
tour together with nuns.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, having arranged together with nuns, go along
the same high-road?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks … the same high-road?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.” The enlightened one, the lord rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men … same high-road? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
trailing should be set forth:</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk, having arranged together with a nun, should go along the same
high-road, even among villages, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.27.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.27.2.1"></a>
Now at that time several monks and nuns
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.63" href="#Vin.4.63"></a>
came to be going along the high-road from Sāketa
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.289" href="#BD.2.289"></a>
to Sāvatthī. Then these nuns spoke thus to these monks:</p>
<p>“We will go along with the masters.”</p>
<p>“Sisters, it is not allowable, having arranged together with a nun, to go along
the same high-road. Either you go first, or we will go (first).”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, the masters are the highest men, so let the masters go first.”</p>
<p>Then as those nuns were going last thieves robbed them on the way and assaulted
them. Then these nuns, having arrived at Sāvatthī, told this matter to the
nuns. The nuns … to the monks. The monks … to the lord. Then the lord, on this
occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to go along the same high-road, having arranged together
with a nun, if it is on a road agreed upon as dangerous, frightening, (where)
one must go with a weapon. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, having arranged together with a nun, should go along the same
high-road, even among villages, except at the right time, there is an offence
of expiation. In this case this is the right time: if a road becomes agreed
upon as dangerous, frightening, (where) one must go with a weapon. This is the
right time in this case.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.27.2.3"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Together with</span> means:
<span class="gloss">together.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.290" href="#BD.2.290"></a>
<span class="term">Having arranged</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if one arranges, saying, ‘We are going, sister, we are going, master, we are
going, master, we are going, sister, we are going either today or tomorrow or
the next day,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Even among villages</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in a village close enough for a cock (to walk), among every (such) village,
there is an offence of expiation. For every half <i lang="pi">yojana</i> in what is not a village, in a jungle, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Except at the right time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the right time.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A road where one must go with a weapon</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it comes to be impossible to go without a weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Dangerous</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, on this road, a place where thieves are halting is seen, a place where they
are eating is seen, a place where they are resting is seen, a place where they
are sitting down is seen, a place where they are lying down is seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Frightening</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if on this road people injured by thieves are seen, (people) plundered are
seen, (people) beaten down are seen. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.64" href="#Vin.4.64"></a>
</span></p>
<p>Having gone to a frightening (place), having seen that it is not frightening,
they should be dismissed, with the words, ‘Go, sisters.’</p>

If he thinks that it was arranged when it was arranged, (and) goes along the
same high-road even among villages, except at the right time, there is an
offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it was arranged … If he
thinks that it was not arranged when it was arranged … there is an offence of
expiation. If a monk arranges (and) a nun does not arrange, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it was arranged when it was not arranged,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it was not
arranged, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it was not
arranged when it was not arranged, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.27.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.27.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if it is at the right time; if he goes not having arranged;
if the nun arranges (and) the monk does not arrange; if they go without
(making) a rendezvous; if there are dangers; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
