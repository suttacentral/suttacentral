… at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time a chief minister, the
venerable Channa’s supporter, was having a dwelling-place built for the
venerable Channa. Then the venerable Channa again and again had the finished
dwelling-place roofed, again and again had it plastered. The overloaded
dwelling-place fell down. Then the venerable Channa, collecting grass and
sticks, despoiled the cornfield of a certain brahmin. Then that brahmin looked
down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the revered ones despoil our cornfields?” Monks heard this brahmin who
… spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Channa again and again have a finished dwelling-place
roofed, again and again have it plastered (so that) the overloaded
dwelling-place falls down?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Channa, again and again had a finished
dwelling-place roofed … so that the overloaded dwelling-place fell down?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, again and again have a finished dwelling-place
roofed, again and again have it plastered, (so that) the overloaded
dwelling-place falls down? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a large dwelling-place is being built for a monk, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.258" href="#BD.2.258"></a>
an enclosure of two or three roofings may be determined upon for placing the
door-bolts, for making the window-holes as far as the door-way, in establishing
it where there are no crops. If, though established where there are no crops,
he should determine upon (something) more than that, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

If he thinks that it is more when it is more than two or three enclosures (and)

or three enclosures (and) determines upon, there is an offence of expiation. If
he thinks that it is more when it is less than two or three enclosures, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is less than
