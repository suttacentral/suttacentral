… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time the nun Thullanandā came to frequent a certain family as a regular diner.
And monks who were elders came to be invited by that householder. Then the nun
Thullanandā, dressing in the morning, taking her bowl and robe, approached that
family, and having approached, she said to that householder:</p>
<p>“Householder, why is this abundant solid food and soft food prepared?”</p>
<p>“Lady, elders are invited by me.”</p>
<p>“But who are the elders for you, householder?”</p>
<p>“Master Sāriputta, master Moggallāna the Great, master Kaccāna the Great,
master Koṭṭhita the Great, master Kappina the Great, master Cunda the Great,
master Anuruddha, master Revata, master Upāli, master Ānanda, master Rāhula.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.296" href="#BD.2.296"></a>
“But why did you, householder, invite fellows posing as great heroes?”</p>
<p>“But who are the great heroes for you, sister?”</p>
<p>“Master Devadatta, master Kokālika, master Kaṭamorakatissaka, master the son of
the lady Khaṇḍā, master Samuddadatta.”</p>
<p>Now this chance talk of the nun Thullanandā was interrupted when these monks
who were elders entered. She said:</p>
<p>“Householder, is it true that the great heroes are invited by you?”</p>
<p>“You, lady, called (them) now ‘fellows,’ now ‘great heroes,’” he said, and he
turned her out of the house and put an end to regular dining. Those who were
modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can Devadatta eat alms-food knowing that it was procured through (the
intervention of) a nun?”</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Devadatta, ate alms-food knowing that it was
procured through (the intervention of) a nun?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, eat alms-food knowing that it was procured through
(the intervention of) a nun? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.67" href="#Vin.4.67"></a>
</p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should eat alms-food knowing that <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.297" href="#BD.2.297"></a>
it was procured through (the intervention of) a nun, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.29.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.29.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.29.2.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk who had gone forth from Kajagaha arrived at a
family of (his) relations. People, saying: “At last the revered sir is come,”
duly made ready a meal. A nun who frequented that family spoke thus to these
people:</p>
<p>“Sirs, give a meal to the master.”</p>
<p>Then that monk, thinking: “It is forbidden by the lord to eat alms-food knowing
that it was procured through (the intervention of) a nun,” being scrupulous,
did not accept it; he was not able to walk for alms, he became famished. Then
that monk, having gone to the monastery, told this matter to the monks. The
monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to eat alms-food knowing that it was procured through (the
intervention of) a nun, if there is a prior arrangement with the householder.
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should eat alms-food knowing that it was procured through (the
intervention of) a nun, unless there is a prior arrangement with the
householder, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself, or others tell him, or she herself tells him.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.298" href="#BD.2.298"></a>
<span class="term">A nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one ordained by both Orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Procures</span> means:
<span class="gloss">previously not desirous of giving, not desirous of treating him, if she says:
“The master is a repeater, the master is very learned, the master is versed in
the Suttantas, the master is an expert in Vinaya, the master is a speaker of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, give to the master, treat the master”: this means procures.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Alms-food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one meal of the five (kinds of) meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Unless there is a prior arrangement with the house-holder</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside the arrangement with the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">An arrangement with the householder</span> means:
<span class="gloss">they are relations or they are invited or they are ordinarily prepared (for the
monk).</span></p>
<p>If he says: “I will eat,” and accepts (a meal), unless there is a prior
arrangement with the householder, there is an offence of wrong-doing. For each
mouthful there is an offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.68" href="#Vin.4.68"></a>
</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.29.3.2" href="#Bu-Pc.29.3.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is procured when it is procured (and) eats it, unless
there is a prior arrangement with the householder, there is an offence of
expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is procured (and) eats … with the
householder, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not
procured when it is procured (and) eats … with the householder, there is no
offence. If he eats what is procured through (the intervention of) one ordained
by one (Order only), unless there is a prior arrangement with the house-holder,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is procured when it is
not procured, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.299" href="#BD.2.299"></a>
it is not procured, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is
not procured when it is not procured, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.29.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.29.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if there is a prior arrangement with the householder; if a
female probationer procures it, if a female novice procures it; setting aside
the five (kinds of) meals, there is no offence in (eating) any others; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
