… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, having indulged in bad habits, protested when a
(formal) act was being carried out against each one. Now at that time the Order
came to be convened on some business or other. The group of six monks, making
robes, gave (their) consent to one. Then the Order, saying:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this monk of the sixfold group is come alone; come, let us
carry out a (formal) act against him,” carried out a (formal) act against him.
Then that monk approached the group of six monks. The group of six monks spoke
thus to that monk: “What did the Order do, your reverence?”</p>
<p>“The Order carried out a (formal) act against me, your reverences.”</p>
<p>“Your reverence, we did not give the consent for this, that it would carry out
a (formal) act against you. If we had known that it would carry out a (formal)
act against you, we should not have given the consent.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the group of
six monks, having given <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.59" href="#BD.3.59"></a>
(their) consent for legitimate (formal) acts, afterwards engage in criticism?”
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.152" href="#Vin.4.152"></a>
having given (your) consent for legitimate (formal) acts, afterwards engage in
criticism?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, having given (your) consent … afterwards engage in
criticism? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, having given (his) consent for legitimate (formal) acts, should
afterwards engage in criticism, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Legitimate (formal) act</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a (formal) act for which leave ought to be asked, a (formal) act at which a
motion is put, a (formal) act at which a motion is put and followed by one
proclamation, a (formal) act <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.60" href="#BD.3.60"></a>
at which a motion is put and is followed by three proclamations; carried out
according to rule, according to discipline, according to the teacher’s
instruction, this is called a legitimate (formal) act.</span></p>
<p>Having given (his) consent, if he criticises, there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.79.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.79.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and), having given (his) consent, criticises, there is an offence of
expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a
legally valid act … no offence. If he thinks that it is a legally valid act
when it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
is in doubt as to whether it is not a legally valid act, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a
legally valid act, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.79.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.79.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he criticises, knowing, “The (formal) act was carried
out according to what is not the rule or by an incomplete assembly or against
one not suitable for a (formal) act”; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
