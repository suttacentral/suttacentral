… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having gone to the house of a
friend, sat down in a private place together with his wife, the one with the
other. Then that man … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can master Upananda sit down in a private place together with a woman, the
one with the other?”</p>
<p>Monks heard this man who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saving:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, sit down in a private
place together with a woman, the one with the other?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, sat down … the one with the
other?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, sit down … the one with the other? It is not,
foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should sit down in a private place together with a woman, the one
with the other, there is an offence of expiation.” </span></p>
