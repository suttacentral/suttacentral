… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, going to a friend’s house, sat
down in a sleeping-room together with his wife. Then that man approached the
venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, and having approached, having
greeted the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, he sat down at a
respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, that man
spoke thus to his wife:</p>
<p>“Give alms-food to the master.”</p>
<p>Then that woman gave alms-food to the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans. Then that man spoke thus to the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans:</p>
<p>“You may go, honoured sir, inasmuch as alms-food has been given to the master.”</p>
<p>Then that woman, observing, ‘This man is obsessed,’ spoke thus to the venerable
Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Sit down, honoured sir, do not go away.”</p>
<p>A second time that man … A third time that man spoke thus to the venerable
Upananda, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“You may go, honoured sir, inasmuch as alms-food has been given to the master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.355" href="#BD.2.355"></a>
A third time did that woman say to the venerable Upananda, the son of the
Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Sit down, honoured sir, do not go away.” Then that man, going out, made monks
look down upon (Upananda), saying:</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, this master Upananda is sitting in the sleeping-room together
with my wife; he, being dismissed by me, does not wish to go. We are very busy,
there is much to be done.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, intruding upon a
family with food, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.95" href="#Vin.4.95"></a>
sit down?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Upananda, intruding upon … sat down?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying: “How can you, foolish man,
intruding … sit down? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, intruding upon a family with food, should sit down, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.356" href="#BD.2.356"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Family with food</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there is a woman and also a man, and both the woman and the man are not gone
out, both are not without passion.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Intruding</span> means:
<span class="gloss">forcing a way into.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should sit down</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he sits down in a large house, having left (the space of) a reach of the
hand from door-posts and lintel, there is an offence of expiation; if he sits
down in a small house, having gone beyond the beam, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.43.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.43.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a sleeping-room when it is a sleeping-room (and),
intruding upon a family with food, sits down, there is an offence of expiation.
If he is in doubt as to whether it is a sleeping-room … If he thinks that it is
not a sleeping-room when it is a sleeping-room … an offence of expiation. If he
thinks that it is a sleeping-room when it is not a sleeping-room, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a
sleeping-room, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not
a sleeping-room when it is not a sleeping-room, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.43.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.43.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he sits down in a large house, not having left (the
space of) a reach of the hand from door-posts and lintel; if he sits down in a
small house, not having gone beyond the beam; if there comes to be a second
monk; if both have gone out; if both are with-out passion; if it is not in a
sleeping-room; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
