… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.46" href="#Vin.4.46"></a>
time two monks (were) in a lofty cell with an upper part, in a dwelling-place
belonging to the Order; one lived below, one above. The monk above sat down
suddenly on a couch with removable feet. The foot of the couch, falling off,
hit the lower monk on the head, (and) this monk uttered a cry of distress.
Monks, running up, said to this monk:</p>
<p>“Why do you, your reverence, utter a cry of distress?”</p>
<p>Then that monk told this matter to the monks. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can a monk, in a lofty cell with an upper part, in a dwelling-place
belonging to the Order, sit down suddenly on a couch with removable feet?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, in a lofty cell with an upper part, in
a dwelling-place belonging to the Order, sat down suddenly on a couch with
removable feet?” …</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.255" href="#BD.2.255"></a>
“… It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And
thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, in a lofty cell with an upper part, in a dwelling-place
belonging to the Order, should sit down or lie down on a couch or chair with
removable feet, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Dwelling-place belonging to the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Lofty cell</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it does not touch the head of a man of medium height.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Couch with removable feet</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having perforated the legs, it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Chair with removable feet</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having perforated the legs, it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should sit down on</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he sits down on it, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should lie down on</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he lies down on it, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.18.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.18.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to the Order, (and)
sits down on or lies down on a couch or a chair with removable feet in a lofty
cell with an upper part, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as
to whether it belongs to the Order … If he thinks that it belongs to an
individual <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.256" href="#BD.2.256"></a>
when it belongs to the Order … with an upper part, there is an offence of
expiation. If he thinks that it belongs to the Order when it belongs to an
individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether
it belongs to an individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks
that it belongs to an individual when it belongs to an individual (but) to
another individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing; if it belongs to the
individual himself, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.18.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.18.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is in a cell that is not lofty; if he is in one that
touches the head; if the one below comes to be not in use; if there comes to be
an accumulation of boards; if a pin is provided; if standing on it he takes
down from or hangs up on; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
