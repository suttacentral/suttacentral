… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time the venerable Dabba the Mallian assigned lodgings to the Order and
distributed meals. And the venerable one’s robe became worn thin. Now at that
time one robe accrued to the Order. Then the Order gave this robe to the
venerable Dabba the Mallian. The group of six monks looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about, saying: “The monks are appropriating a benefit
belonging to the Order according to acquaintanceship.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of
six monks, having given away a robe by means of a complete Order, afterwards
engage in criticism?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, having given away a robe … afterwards
engaged in criticism?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, having given away a robe … afterwards engage in
criticism? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.65" href="#BD.3.65"></a>
</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, having given away a robe by means of a complete Order, should
afterwards engage in criticism, saying: “The monks are appropriating a benefit
belonging to the Order according to acquaintanceship,” there is an offence of
expiation.</span>”</p>

(and) criticises when a robe is given, there is an offence of expiation. If he
is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … If he thinks that it is
not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act … offence of expiation.

There is no offence if he criticises, saying: ‘What is the use of giving to one
acting by nature from desire, from hatred, from confusion, from fear? For
having received it, he will ruin it, he will not look after it properly if he
is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
