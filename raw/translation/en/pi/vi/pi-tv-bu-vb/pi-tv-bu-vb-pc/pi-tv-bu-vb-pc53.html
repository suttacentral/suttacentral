<h1>Monks’ Expiation (<i lang="pi">Pācittiya</i>) 53</h1>

… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of seventeen monks were sporting in the water of the river Aciravatī.
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.112" href="#Vin.4.112"></a>
Now at that time King Pasenadi, the Kosalan, came to be on the upper storey of
the palace together with Queen Mallikā. King Pasenadi, the Kosalan, saw the
group of seventeen monks sporting in the water of the river Aciravati; seeing
them he spoke thus to Queen Mallikā:</p>
<p>“Mallikā, these who are sporting in the water are men perfected.”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, sire, a rule of training has not been laid down by the lord, or
these monks are not conversant (with it).”</p>
<p>Then it occurred to King Pasenadi, the Kosalan:</p>
<p>“Is there not some device by which I would not speak to the lord but (yet) the
lord would know that these monks sported in the water?”</p>
<p>Then King Pasenadi, the Kosalan, having had the group of seventeen monks
summoned, gave them a large sugar-ball, saying:</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, give this sugar-ball to the lord.”</p>
<p>The group of seventeen monks, taking that sugar-ball, approached the lord, and
having approached they spoke thus to the lord:</p>
<p>“Lord, King Pasenadi, the Kosalan, gives this sugar-ball to the lord.”</p>
<p>“But, monks, where did the King see you?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.391" href="#BD.2.391"></a>
“Sporting in the water of the river Aciravatī, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, sport in the water? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In playing in the water, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.53.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.53.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.53.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Playing in the water</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if desiring, laughter he immerses (the part) above the ankle in the water, or
draws it out or swims, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.53.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.53.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is playing when it is playing in the water, there is an
offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is playing in the
water … If he thinks that it is not playing when it is playing in the water,
there is an offence of expiation. If he sports in the water with (the part)
below the ankle, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he sports with a boat,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he strikes the water with the hand or
with the foot or with a stick or with a sherd, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he sports with water in a bowl, or with sour rice-gruel or with
milk or with butter-milk or with dye-stuff or with urine or with mud, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is playing when it is not
playing in the water, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as
to whether it is not playing in the water, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he thinks that it is not playing when it is not playing in the water, there
is no offence.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.392" href="#BD.2.392"></a>
There is no offence if, not desiring laughter, plunging into the water if there
is something to be done, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.113" href="#Vin.4.113"></a>
he immerses or draws out or swims; if, going to the other side, he immerses or
draws out or swims; if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
