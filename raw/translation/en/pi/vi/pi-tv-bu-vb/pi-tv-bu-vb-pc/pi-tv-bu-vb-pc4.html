… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time,
the group of six monks made lay-followers speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> line by line; the lay-followers were disrespectful, not deferential towards
the monks, they did not live in harmony. Those who were modest monks looked
down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks make lay-followers speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> line by line? The lay-followers are disrespectful … they do not live in
harmony.”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, made lay-followers speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> line by line, (and that) lay-followers … in harmony?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.” The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, make lay-followers speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> line by line, (so that) lay-followers … in harmony? It is not, foolish men,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increase in those who are
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should make one who is not ordained speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> line by line, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
