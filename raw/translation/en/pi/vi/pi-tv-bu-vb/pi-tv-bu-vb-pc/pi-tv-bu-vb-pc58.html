… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
many monks and wanderers were going along the high-road from Sāketa to
Sāvatthī. On the way, thieves, having issued forth, robbed them. At Sāvatthī
hirelings of the king, having issued forth, having seized these thieves with
the goods, sent a messenger to the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Let the revered sirs come; let each, recognising his own robe, take it.”</p>
<p>The monks did not recognise them. They looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the revered sirs not recognise their own robes?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this
matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having
had the Order of monks convened, having given reasoned talk on what is
befitting, on what is suitable, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training for monks based
on ten grounds: for the excellence of the Order, for the comfort of the Order …
for establishing what is verily <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, for following discipline. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a monk obtains a new robe, any one mode of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.407" href="#BD.2.407"></a>
disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement must be taken: either dark
green or mud(-colour) or black. If a monk should make use of a new robe without
taking any one mode of disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement, there
is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.58.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.58.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">New</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called so if not made allowable.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Any one mode of disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement must be taken</span> means:
<span class="gloss">even (as little as) with a blade of grass must be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Dark green</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) dark <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.408" href="#BD.2.408"></a>
green: the dark green of bronze, the dark green of foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Mud</span>(-colour) means:
<span class="gloss">it is called water.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Black</span> means:
<span class="gloss">anything that is of black.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If a monk … without taking any one mode of disfigurement of the three modes of
disfigurement</span> means:
<span class="gloss"> <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.121" href="#Vin.4.121"></a>
if a monk makes use of a new robe without having taken any one mode of
disfigurement of the three modes of disfigurement, even (as little as) with a
blade of grass, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.58.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.58.2.2"></a>
If he makes use of it, thinking that he has not taken when he has not taken,
there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether he has not
taken … If he makes use of it, thinking that he has taken when he has not
taken, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that he has not taken
when he has taken, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether he has taken, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he
has taken when he has taken, there is no offence.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.409" href="#BD.2.409"></a>
There is no offence if, having taken, he makes use of it; if what is allowable
becomes destroyed; if what made the appearance allowable becomes worn away; if
what was not made allowable becomes sewn together with what was made allowable;
if there is a patch; if there is a braiding; if there is a binding <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.410" href="#BD.2.410"></a>
; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
