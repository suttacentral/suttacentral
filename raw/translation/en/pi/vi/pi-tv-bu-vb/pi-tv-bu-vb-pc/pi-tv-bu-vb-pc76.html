… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks defamed a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence
entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Those who were modest monks … spread
it about, saying: “How can the group of six monks defame … formal meeting of
the Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, defamed a monk with an unfounded
charge of an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order?” “It is true,
lord.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.148" href="#Vin.4.148"></a>
</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
defame … formal meeting of the Order? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should defame a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence
entailing a formal meeting of the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.76.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.76.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">another monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Unfounded</span> means:
<span class="gloss">unseen, unheard, unsuspected. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one of the thirteen (offences entailing this penalty).</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.52" href="#BD.3.52"></a>
<span class="term">Should defame</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he reprimands him or causes (another) to reprimand him, there is an offence
of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.76.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.76.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that one is ordained when he is ordained, and defames (him) with
an unfounded charge of an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order,
there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether one is
ordained… If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is ordained … offence
of expiation. If he defames (him) in respect of a falling away from right
habits or a falling away from right views, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
If he defames one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
he thinks that one is ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.76.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.76.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, thinking what is true, he reprimands him or causes
(another) to reprimand him; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
