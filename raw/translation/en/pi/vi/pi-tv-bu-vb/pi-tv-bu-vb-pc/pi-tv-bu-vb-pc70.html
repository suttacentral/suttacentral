<h1>Monks’ Expiation (<i lang="pi">Pācittiya</i>) 70</h1>

… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a pernicious view had arisen to the novice Kaṇḍaka, like this: “In so far as I
understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p>Several monks heard: “A pernicious view has arisen to the novice Kaṇḍaka …” <span class="add">See
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc68#Bu-Pc.68.1">Bu-Pc.68.1</a>.
<em>Instead of</em> the monk Ariṭṭha, who was formerly a vulture-trainer,
<em>read</em> the novice Kaṇḍaka;
<em>instead of</em> Ariṭṭha, Kaṇḍaka;
<em>in his reply to the monks read honoured sir instead of</em> your reverence.</span> …</p>
<p>“… It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … and
it causes wavering in some.”</p>
<p>Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Because of this, monks, let the Order expel the novice Kaṇḍaka. And thus,
monks, should he be expelled: ‘From today forth, reverend Kaṇḍaka, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.139" href="#Vin.4.139"></a>
the lord can neither be referred to as your teacher, nor can that be yours of
which other novices have the chance, namely the lying down to sleep for two or
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.32" href="#BD.3.32"></a>
three nights with monks. Get away with you, depart.’”</p>
<p>Then the Order expelled the novice Kaṇḍaka. Now at that time the group of six
monks knowingly encouraged and supported and ate with and lay down in a
sleeping-place with the novice Kaṇḍaka, thus expelled. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks knowingly encourage and support and eat with
and lie down in a sleeping-place with the novice Kaṇḍaka, thus expelled?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly encourage and support and
eat with and lie down in a sleeping-place with the novice Kaṇḍaka, thus
expelled?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, knowingly encourage … thus expelled? It is not,
foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If even a novice should speak thus: ‘In so far as I understand
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the lord, it is that in following those things called
stumbling-blocks by the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.33" href="#BD.3.33"></a>
lord, there is no stumbling-block at all,” that novice should be spoken to thus
by the monks: ‘Do not speak thus, reverend novice; do not misrepresent the
lord, misrepresentation of the lord is not at all seemly, and the lord
certainly would not speak thus. Reverend novice, in many a figure are things
that are stumbling-blocks called stumbling-blocks by the lord, and in following
these, there is a veritable stumbling-block.’ And if that novice, when he has
been spoken to thus by the monks, should persist as before, that novice should
be spoken to thus by the monks: ‘From today forth, reverend novice, the lord
can neither be referred to as your teacher, nor can that be yours of which
other novices get the chance, namely, the lying down to sleep for two or three
nights with monks. Get away with you, depart.’ Whatever monk should knowingly
encourage or should support or should eat with or should lie down in a
sleeping-place with a novice thus expelled, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
