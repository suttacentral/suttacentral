… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks knowingly made use of water that contained living
things. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks knowingly make use of water that contains
living things?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly made use of water that
contained living things?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, knowingly make use of water that contains living
things? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly make use of water that contains living things,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he knows by himself or others tell him.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">That contains living things</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, knowing (this), he makes use of it knowing that “they will die from (this)
use,” there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.4" href="#BD.3.4"></a>
If he thinks that it contains living things when it contains living things
(and) makes use of it, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as
to whether it contains living things (and) makes use of it, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it does not contain living things when it
contains living things (and) makes use of it, there is no offence. If he thinks
that it contains living things when it does not contain living things, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it does not contain
living things, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it does
not contain living things when it does not contain living things, there is no
offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.62.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.62.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he makes use of it not knowing that it contains living
things, knowing that it does not contain living things, knowing that they will
not die from this use; if he is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.</p>
