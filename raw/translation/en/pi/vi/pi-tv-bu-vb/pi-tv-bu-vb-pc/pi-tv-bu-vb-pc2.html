… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time,
the group of six monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, insulted the well
behaved monks; they jeered at them, they scoffed at them about birth and name
and clan and work and craft and disease and distinguishing mark and passion and
attainment and low mode of address. Those who were modest monks looked down
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.5" href="#Vin.4.5"></a>
insult the well behaved monks? How can they jeer at them, scoff at them about
birth … low mode of address?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He
said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, quarrelling with well behaved monks,
insulted the well behaved monks, jeered at them … about low mode of address?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men,
quarrelling with well behaved monks, insult the well behaved monks, jeer <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.172" href="#BD.2.172"></a>
at them, scoff at them about … low mode of address? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” And having rebuked them and given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<hr>
<div class="jataka">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.2.1.2" href="#Bu-Pc.2.1.2"></a>
“Formerly, monks, at Takkasilā, Nandivisāla was the name of an ox belonging to
a certain brahmin. Then, monks, Nandivisāla, the ox, spoke thus to the brahmin:
‘Brahmin, you go, bet a thousand with the great merchant, saying: “My ox will
draw a hundred carts tied together.”’ Then, monks, that brahmin made a bet of a
thousand with the great merchant, saying: ‘My ox will draw a hundred carts tied
together.’ Then, monks, that brahmin having tied together a hundred carts,
having yoked Nandivisāla, the ox, spoke thus: ‘Go, hornless one, let the
hornless one pull them along.’ Then, monks, Nandivisāla, the ox, stood just
where he was. Then, monks, that brahmin, having suffered the loss of a
thousand, was overcome by grief. Then, monks, Nandivisāla, the ox, spoke thus
to the brahmin: ‘Why are you, brahmin, overcome by grief?’</p>
<p>‘Because I, good sir, suffered the loss of a thousand through you.’</p>
<p>‘But why do you, brahmin, bring me, who am not hornless, into disgrace with
words of deceit? Brahmin, you go, bet two thousand with the great merchant,
saying: “My ox will draw a hundred carts tied together,” but do not bring me,
who am not hornless, into disgrace with words of deceit.’</p>
<p>Then, monks, that brahmin bet two thousand with the great merchant, saying: ‘My
ox will draw a hundred carts tied together.’ Then, monks, that brahmin having <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.173" href="#BD.2.173"></a>
tied together a hundred carts, having yoked Nandivisala, the ox, spoke thus:
‘Go, good creature, let the good creature pull them along.’ Then, monks,
Nandivisala, the ox, drew the hundred carts tied together.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Speak only words of kindness,
<br>
never words unkind.<br>
For him who spoke him fair, he moved<br>
A heavy load, and brought him wealth, for love.

<p>At that time, monks, jeering and scoffing were not liked by me, so however
could jeering and scoffing become liked now? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
