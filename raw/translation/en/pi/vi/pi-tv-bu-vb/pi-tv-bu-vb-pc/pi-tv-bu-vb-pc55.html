… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks frightened the group of seventeen monks. These, being
frightened, cried out. Monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Why do you, your reverences, cry out?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks frightened us.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks frighten a monk?” … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc52#Bu-Pc.52.1">Bu-Pc.52.1</a></span> … “… should be set forth:</p>

“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should frighten a monk, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">another monk.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should frighten</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if one who is ordained, desirous of frightening one who is ordained, arranges a
form or a sound or a smell or a taste or a touch, whether he is afraid or
whether he is not afraid, there is an offence of expiation. If he points out
the wilds of thieves, or the wilds of beasts of prey, or the wilds of goblins,
whether he is afraid or whether he is not afraid, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.55.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.55.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that he is ordained when he is ordained (and) frightens (him),
there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.397" href="#BD.2.397"></a>
If he is in doubt as to whether he is ordained … If he thinks that he is not
ordained when he is ordained (and) frightens (him), there is an offence of
expiation. If he is desirous of frightening one who is not ordained (and)
arranges a form … a touch, whether he is afraid or whether he is not afraid,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he points out the wilds of thieves … or
whether he is not afraid, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that
he is ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.115" href="#Vin.4.115"></a>
If he is in doubt as to whether he is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is not ordained when he is not ordained,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.55.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.55.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, not desirous of frightening, he arranges a form or a
sound or a smell or a taste or a touch, or points out the wilds of thieves or
the wilds of beasts of prey or the wilds of goblins; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
