… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
at Sāvatthī food with robe-material was prepared for the Order by a certain
guild, saying: “Having offered food, we will present them with robe-material.”
Then the group of six monks approached that guild, and having approached, they
said to that guild: “Sirs, give these robes to these monks.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, we will not give; almsfood with robes are made ready by us
every year for the Order.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, many are the Order’s benefactors, many are the Order’s devotees. These
(monks) are here depending on you, looking to you, but if you will not give to
them, then <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.156" href="#Vin.4.156"></a>
who is there who will give to them? Sirs, give these robes to these monks.”</p>
<p>Then that guild, being pressed by the group of six monks, giving the group of
six monks as much robe-material as was prepared, served the Order with a meal.
Those monks who knew that robe-material with a meal was prepared for the Order
and did not know that it was given to the group of six monks, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Sirs, dedicate robe-material to the Order.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, there is none; the masters, the group of six monks appropriated
to the masters, the group of six monks, as much robe-material as was
prepared.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks knowingly appropriate to an individual an
apportioned benefit belonging to the Order?” …</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.68" href="#BD.3.68"></a>
“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, knowingly appropriated to an
individual an apportioned benefit belonging to the Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, knowingly appropriate to an individual an
apportioned benefit belonging to the Order? It is not, foolish men, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should knowingly appropriate to an individual an apportioned
benefit belonging to the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">He knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either he knows by himself or others tell him or (someone) tells him.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Belonging to the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it comes to be given to the Order, handed over to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A benefit</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick, and even a
lump of chunam and a toothpick and unwoven thread.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Apportioned</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if it has been expressly said: “We will give, we will make,” (and) he
appropriates it to an individual, there is an offence of expiation. </span></p>

If he thinks that it is apportioned when it is apportioned (and) appropriates
it to an individual, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is apportioned (and) appropriates it to an individual, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not apportioned when it is
apportioned (and) appropriates it to an individual, there is no offence. If he
appropriates what is apportioned to the Order for another (part of the) Order
or for a shrine, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he appropriates what is
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.69" href="#BD.3.69"></a>
apportioned to a shrine for another shrine or for the Order or for an
individual, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he appropriates what is
apportioned to an individual for another individual or for an Order or for a
shrine, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is apportioned
when it is not apportioned, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in
doubt as to whether it is not apportioned, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.157" href="#Vin.4.157"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not apportioned
when it is not apportioned, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.82.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.82.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he himself being asked, ‘Where do we give?’ says, ‘Give
wherever your gift could be used or could be mended or should be for a long
time or when for you the mind is peaceful;’ if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
