<h1>Monks’ Expiation (<i lang="pi">Pācittiya</i>) 13</h1>

… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding-place. Now at that
time the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, assigned lodgings to the Order and
distributed meals. Now at that time monks who were followers of Mettiya and
Bhummajaka were newly ordained as well as of little merit; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.38" href="#Vin.4.38"></a>
they obtained whatever inferior lodgings belonged to the Order and inferior
meals. These made monks look down upon the venerable Dabba, the Mallian,
saying:</p>
<p>“Dabba, the Mallian, assigns lodgings through favouritism and distributes meals
through favouritism.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can monks who are followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka make monks look down
upon the venerable Dabba, the Mallian?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, made monks look down upon Dabba, the
Mallian?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, make monks look down upon Dabba, the Mallian? It is
not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“In making (someone) look down upon, there is an offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.236" href="#BD.2.236"></a>
Now at that time monks who were followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka thought:
“Making (someone) look down upon is forbidden by the lord, (but) this much
shall the monks hear,” and in the neighbourhood of monks, they criticised the
venerable Dabba, the Mallian, saying:</p>
<p>“Dabba, the Mallian, assigns lodgings through favouritism and distributes meals
through favouritism.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … <span class="add">as in
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc13#Bu-Pc.13.2.1">Bu-Pc.13.2.1</a>
<em>instead of</em> “make monks look down upon”
<em>read</em> “criticise”</span> … “… And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In making (someone) look down upon, in criticising, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.13.3.1" href="#Bu-Pc.13.3.1"></a>
<span class="term">Making (someone) look down upon</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes (someone) look down upon or if he criticises one who is ordained,
desiring to bring blame, desiring to bring discredit, desiring to bring shame
to one who is ordained (and) agreed upon by the Order as assigner of lodgings
or as distributor of meals or as apportioner of conjey or as apportioner of
fruit or as apportioner of solid foods or as disposer of trifles, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.13.3.2" href="#Bu-Pc.13.3.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act, in
making (someone) look down <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.237" href="#BD.2.237"></a>
upon, in criticising, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is a legally valid act, in making (someone) look down upon, in
criticising, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is not a
legally valid act when it is a legally valid act, in making (someone) look down
upon, in criticising, there is an offence of expiation. If he makes (someone)
look down upon or if he criticises one who is not ordained, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he makes (someone) look down upon or if he criticises one
who is ordained or one who is not ordained, desiring to bring blame, desiring
to bring discredit, desiring to bring shame to one who is ordained (but) not
agreed upon by the Order as assigner of lodgings … as disposer of trifles <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.39" href="#Vin.4.39"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he makes (someone) look down upon or if
he criticises one who is ordained or one who is not ordained, desiring to
blame, desiring to bring discredit, desiring to bring shame to one who is not
ordained, (but) agreed upon or not agreed upon by the Order as assigner of
lodgings … or as disposer of trifles, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a
legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is
not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.13.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.13.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if he makes (someone) look down upon or if he criticises
one acting by nature from desire, from hatred, from stupidity, from fear; if he
is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
