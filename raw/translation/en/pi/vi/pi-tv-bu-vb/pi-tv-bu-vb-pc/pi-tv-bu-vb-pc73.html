… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, thinking: “Let them understand that having indulged in
bad habits, we are fallen through ignorance,” while the Pātimokkha was being
recited, spoke thus: “Only now do we understand that this rule is, as is said,
handed down in a clause, contained in a clause, (and) comes up for recitation
every half-month.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of
six monks speak thus while the Pātimokkha is being recited … ‘… every
half-month’?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that you spoke thus while the Pātimokkha was
being recited …’ … every half-month’?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, speak thus while the Pātimokkha is being recited: ‘…
every half-month’? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.44" href="#BD.3.44"></a>
“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, while the Pātimokkha is being recited every half-month, should
speak thus: ‘Only now do I understand that this rule is, as is said, handed
down in a clause, contained in a clause, (and) comes up for recitation every
half-month’; if other monks should know concerning this monk that this monk has
sat down two or three times before, not to say oftener, while the Pātimokkha
was being recited, there is not only no freedom for that monk on account of
(his) ignorance, but he ought to be dealt with according to the rule for the
offence into which he has fallen there, and further confusion should be put on
him, saying: ‘Your reverence, this is bad for you, this is badly gotten by you,
that you, while the Pātimokkha is being recited, do not attend applying
yourself properly.’ This for him on whom the confusion is put is an offence of
expiation.</span>”

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Every half-month</span> means:
<span class="gloss">every Observance day.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">When the Pātimokkha is being recited</span> means:
<span class="gloss">when reciting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should speak thus</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he, thinking, “Let them understand that, having indulged in bad habits, I am
fallen through ignorance,” speaks thus, while the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.45" href="#BD.3.45"></a>
Pātimokkha is being recited, “Only now do I understand … every half-month,”
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If … this</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the monk whom they desire to confuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Monks should know (concerning this monk) that he has sat down … further
confusion should be put on him</span>.
<span class="gloss">And thus, monks, should it be put on him: the Order should be informed by an
experienced, competent monk, saying: <span class="kamma">‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk so and so, while the
Pātimokkha was being recited, did not attend applying himself properly. If it
seems right to the Order, the Order should put confusion on the monk so and so.
This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. This monk … did
not attend applying himself properly. The Order is putting confusion on the
monk so and so. If the putting of confusion on the monk so and so is pleasing
to the venerable ones, let them be silent; if it is not pleasing, you should
speak. Confusion is put on the monk so and so by the Order, and it is right …
So do I understand this.’</span></span></p>
<p>If he confuses when confusion is not put on him, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he confuses when confusion is put on him, there is an offence
of expiation.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.73.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.73.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) confuses him, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is a legally valid act … If he thinks that it is not a legally valid
act when it is a legally valid act (and) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.46" href="#BD.3.46"></a>
confuses him, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is a
legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act (and) confuses him, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is not a
legally valid act (and) confuses him, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act,
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.73.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.73.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is not heard in detail; if he is heard in detail
(but) less than two or three times; if he does not desire to confuse; if he is
mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
