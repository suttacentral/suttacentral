… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time
monks were invited by a certain ivory-worker, saying: “If the masters want a
needle case, I (can supply them) with a needle-case.” Then the monks asked for
many needle-cases; they asked for large needle-cases for those who had small
needle-cases, they asked for small needle-cases for those who had large
needle-cases. Then that ivory-worker, making many needle-cases for the monks,
was not able to make other goods for sale, and he did not keep himself going
and his wife and children suffered. People … spread it about, saying: “How can
these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not knowing moderation, ask for many
needle-cases? This (man), making many needle-cases for these (monks), is not
able to make other goods for sale … and his wife and children suffer.” Monks
heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks … spread
it about, saying: “How can these monks, not knowing moderation, ask for many
needle-cases? …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks, not knowing moderation, asked for
many needle-cases?” “It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, monks, not knowing moderation, ask for many needle-cases? It is
not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.88" href="#BD.3.88"></a>
“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should have a needle-case made that is made of bone or made of
ivory or made of horn, there is an offence of expiation involving breaking up.</span>”</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.86.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.86.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Bone</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever is bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Ivory</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called elephant-ivory.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Horn</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whatever is horn.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should have made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes it or causes it to be made, in the action there is an offence of
wrong-doing: having broken it up on acquisition, an offence of expiation is to
be confessed.</span></p>
<p>If what was incompletely executed by himself he has finished by himself, there
is an offence of expiation. If he makes others finish what was incompletely
executed by himself, there is an offence of expiation. If what was incompletely
executed by others he has finished by himself, there is an offence of expiation
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.168" href="#Vin.4.168"></a>
. If he makes others finish what was incompletely executed by others, there is
an offence of expiation. If he makes it or causes it to be made for another,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If, having acquired what was made for
another, he makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.86.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.86.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if it is a block, fire-wood, a
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.89" href="#BD.3.89"></a>
buckle, a box for ointment, a stick to put the ointment on with, the handle of
an adze, a towel; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
