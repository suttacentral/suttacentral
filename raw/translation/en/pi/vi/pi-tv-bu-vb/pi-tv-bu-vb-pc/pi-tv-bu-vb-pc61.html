… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at one time
the venerable Udāyin was an archer, and crows were unpleasant to him. He,
having shot crows, having cut off their heads, put them in a row on a stake.
Monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“By whom, your reverence, were these crows deprived of life?’”</p>
<p>“By me, your reverences; crows are unpleasant to me.” Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Udāyin intentionally deprive a living thing of life?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Udāyin, intentionally deprived a living
thing of life?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, intentionally deprive a living thing of life? It is
not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should intentionally deprive a living thing of life, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">… monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.2" href="#BD.3.2"></a>
<span class="term">Intentionally</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a transgression committed knowingly, consciously, deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Living thing</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called a living thing that is an animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should deprive of life</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he cuts off the faculty of life, destroys it, harms its duration, there is
an offence of expiation. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.125" href="#Vin.4.125"></a>

If he thinks that it is a living thing when it is a living thing, (and)
deprives it of life, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is a living thing, (and) deprives it of life, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not a living thing when it is a living
thing, there is no offence. If he thinks that it is a living thing when it is
not a living thing, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to
whether it is not a living thing, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that it is not a living thing when it is not a living thing, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.61.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.61.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if it is unintentional; if (he is) not thinking; if he does
not know; if he is not meaning death; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
