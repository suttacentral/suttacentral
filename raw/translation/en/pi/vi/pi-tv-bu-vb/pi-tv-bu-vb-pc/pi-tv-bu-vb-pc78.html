… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks quarrelled together with well behaved monks. The well
behaved monks spoke thus: “Your reverences, this group of six monks are
shameless; it is not possible to quarrel together with them.”</p>
<p>The group of six monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your reverences, bring us into
disgrace by speaking (of us) as shameless?”</p>
<p>“But how could you, your reverences, hear?”</p>
<p>“We stood overhearing the venerable ones.” Those who were modest monks … spread
it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks stand overhearing monks when
they are quarrelling, disputing, engaged in contention?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, stood … engaged in contention?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How could you, foolish men, stand … engaged in contention? It is not, foolish
men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should stand overhearing monks when they are quarrelling,
disputing, engaged in contention, saying, ‘I will hear what they say,’ if
having done it for just this object, not for another, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">if hearing these, he goes away, thinking: ‘I will reprove (him), I will remind
(him), I will reprimand (him), I will make (him) remorseful, I will make him
ashamed,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. If standing where he hears, there
is an offence of expiation. If, going behind, he goes quickly, thinking: ‘I
will hear,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. If standing where he hears,
there is an offence of expiation. If, going in front, he stays behind,
thinking, ‘I will hear,’ there is an offence of wrong-doing. If standing where
he hears, there is an offence of expiation. Having come to a place where a monk
is resting or to a place where he is sitting down or to a place where he is
lying down, taking counsel <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.151" href="#Vin.4.151"></a>
he should cough, he should let him know. Should he not cough or should he not
let him know, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having done it for just this object, not for another</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there comes to be no other object whatever (for which) to stand overhearing.</span></p>

offence of expiation. If he stands overhearing one who is not ordained, there
is an offence of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.57" href="#BD.3.57"></a>
wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is ordained when he is not ordained, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not

There is no offence if having heard these he goes away, thinking: ‘I will
desist, I will refrain, I will be calm, I will set myself free’; if he is mad,
if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
