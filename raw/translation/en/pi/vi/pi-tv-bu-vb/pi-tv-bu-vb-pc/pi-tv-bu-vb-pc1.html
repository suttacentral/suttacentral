At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Hatthaka, the son of the
Sakyans, came to be overthrown in debate. He, talking with followers of sects
holding other views, having denied, acknowledged, having acknowledged, denied,
he shelved the question by (asking) another, he told a conscious lie, having
made a rendezvous, he deceived with words. The followers of sects holding other
views looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.165" href="#BD.2.165"></a>
“How can this Hatthaka, the son of the Sakyans, talking together with us,
having denied, acknowledge, having acknowledged, deny, shelve the question by
(asking) another, tell a conscious lie, having made a rendezvous, deceive with
words?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these followers of sects holding other views who looked down upon,
criticised, spread it about. Then these monks approached Hatthaka, the son of
the Sakyans, and having approached, they spoke thus to Hatthaka, the son of the
Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, reverend Hatthaka, talking together with
followers of sects holding other views, having denied, acknowledged … deceived
with words?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, these followers of sects holding other views should be
vanquished in some way; victory should not be given to them thus.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying: “How can this Hatthaka, the son of the Sakyans, talking together with
followers of sects holding other views, having denied, acknowledge, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.2" href="#Vin.4.2"></a>
having acknowledged, deny, shelve the question by (asking) another, tell a
conscious lie, having made a rendezvous, deceive with words?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this occasion,
in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned
Hatthaka, the son of the Sakyans:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Hatthaka, talking together with followers of
sects holding other views, having denied, acknowledged … deceived with words?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, talking together with followers of sects holding
other views, having denied, acknowledge … having made a rendezvous, deceive
with words? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
