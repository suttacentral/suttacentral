… at Āḷavī in the chief shrine at Āḷavī. Now at that time lay-followers came to
the monastery for the sake of hearing <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. When <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> had been spoken, the monks who were elders went to their own dwelling-place,
(but) the monks who were novices lay down in a sleeping-place just there in the
attendance hall together with the lay-followers, careless, thoughtless, naked,
mumbling, snoring. The lay-followers looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the revered sirs lie down in a sleeping-place careless, thoughtless,
naked, mumbling, snoring?”</p>
<p>Monks heard these lay-followers who looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.16" href="#Vin.4.16"></a>
criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these monks lie down in a sleeping-place with one who is not
ordained?”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks lay down in a sleeping-place with
one who is not ordained?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.195" href="#BD.2.195"></a>
“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men lie down in a sleeping-place with one who is
not ordained? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …
And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“Whatever monk should lie down in a sleeping-place with one who is not
ordained, there is an offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.5.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.5.2.1"></a>
Then the lord, having stayed at Āḷavī for as long as he found suitable, set out
on tour for Kosambī. Going along on tour, he arrived in due course at Kosambī.
The lord stayed there at Kosambī in the Badarikā monastery. Monks spoke thus to
the venerable Rāhula:</p>
<p>“Reverend Rāhula, a rule of training laid down by the lord says that there
should be no lying down in a sleeping-place with one who is not ordained.
Reverend Rāhula, find a sleeping-place.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāhula, not obtaining a sleeping-place, lay down in a privy.
Then the lord, getting up in the night towards morning, approached this privy,
and having approached, he coughed and the venerable Rāhula also coughed.</p>
<p>“Who is here?” he said.</p>
<p>“It is I, lord, Rahula,” he said.</p>
<p>“Why are you sitting there, Rahula?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rahula told this matter to the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.196" href="#BD.2.196"></a>
lord. Then the lord in this connection, on this occasion, having given reasoned
talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to lie down in a sleeping-place with one who is not
ordained for two or three nights. And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should lie down in a sleeping-place with one who is not ordained
for more than two or three nights, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Should lie down in a sleeping-place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if at sunset on the fourth day a monk lies down while one who is not ordained
is lying down, there is an offence of expiation. If one who is not ordained
lies down while a monk is lying down, there is an offence of expiation. Or if
both lie down, there is an offence of expiation. If getting up, they lie down
again, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.197" href="#BD.2.197"></a>
If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is not ordained (and) lies down
in a sleeping-place for more than two or three nights, there is an offence of
expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not ordained (and) lies down
in a sleeping-place for more than two or three nights, there is an offence of
expiation. If he thinks that one is ordained when he is not ordained (and) lies
down in a sleeping-place for more than two or three nights, there is an offence
of expiation. If it is half covered, half closed round, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is ordained, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is ordained,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is ordained when he
is ordained, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.5.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.5.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if he stays for two or three nights; if he stays for less
than two or three nights; if having stayed for two nights, departing before
dawn on the third night, he stays again; if it is fully covered (but) not fully
closed round; if it is fully closed round (but) not fully covered; if it is
partially uncovered, partially not closed round; if the monk sits down while
one who is not ordained is lying down; if one who is not ordained sits down
while the monk is lying down; or if both sit down; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
