… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of seventeen monks did not store their requisites. The group of six
monks hid a bowl and a robe belonging to the group of seventeen monks. The
group of seventeen monks spoke thus to the group of six monks:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, give back <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.123" href="#Vin.4.123"></a>
the bowl and the robe to us.”</p>
<p>The group of six monks laughed; these cried out. Monks spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Why do you, your reverences, cry out?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks are hiding a bowl and a robe
belonging to us.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six monks hide a bowl and a robe belonging to monks?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, are hiding a bowl and a robe
belonging to monks?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, hide a bowl and a robe belonging to monks? It is
not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should hide or should cause to hide a monk’s bowl or robe or
(piece of cloth) to sit upon or needle-case or girdle, even in fun, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

There is no offence if he is not desiring fun; if he puts in order what is
badly arranged; if he puts it in order, thinking, ‘I will give it back, having
given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk’; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
