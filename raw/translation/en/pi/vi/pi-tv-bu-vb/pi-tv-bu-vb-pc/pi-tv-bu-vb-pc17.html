… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time the
group of seventeen monks were repairing a large dwelling-place in the
neighbourhood, thinking: “We will spend the rains here.”</p>
<p>The group of six monks saw the group of seventeen monks as they were repairing
the dwelling-place, and seeing them, they said:</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of seventeen monks are repairing a dwelling-place.
Come, we will turn them away.”</p>
<p>Some spoke thus: “Wait, your reverences, until they have repaired it; when it
is repaired, we will turn them away.”</p>
<p>Then the group of six monks said to the group of seventeen monks: “Go away,
your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to us.”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, should not this have been explained before, and we would have
repaired another?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, does not the dwelling-place belong to the Order?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to the Order.”</p>
<p>“Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to us.”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, the dwelling-place is big; you stay, and we too will stay.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.251" href="#BD.2.251"></a>
“Go away, your reverences, the dwelling-place belongs to us,” and angry,
displeased, taking them by the throat they threw them out. These being thrown
out, wept. Monks said (to them):</p>
<p>“Why do you, your reverences, weep?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased threw us out of a
dwelling-place belonging to the Order.”</p>
<p>Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, angry, displeased, throw out monks from a
dwelling-place belonging to the Order?” Then these monks told this matter to
the lord…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that you, angry and displeased … to the Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, angry … belonging to the Order? Foolish men, it is
not for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule
of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should throw out a monk or cause him to be
thrown out from a dwelling-place belonging to the Order, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>
