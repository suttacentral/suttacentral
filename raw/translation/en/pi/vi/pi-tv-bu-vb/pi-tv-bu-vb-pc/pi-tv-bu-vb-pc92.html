… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Nanda, the son of the lord’s aunt, was beautiful, good to look
upon, charming, four finger-breadths less (in height) than the lord. He wore a
robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe. Monks who were elders saw the
venerable Nanda coming from afar; seeing him, saying: “The lord is coming,”
they rose from their seats. These, recognising him when he had come, looked
down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Nanda wear a robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe?”
They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord questioned the venerable
Nanda, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Nanda, wore a robe the measure of a
well-farer’s robe?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, Nanda, wear a robe the measure of a well-farer’s robe? It is not,
Nanda, for pleasing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.101" href="#BD.3.101"></a>
those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should
be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should have a robe made the measure of a well-farer’s robe, or
more, there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down. This is the
(proper) measure here of a well-farer’s robe for a well-farer: in length nine
spans of the accepted span, in breadth six spans; this is the (proper) measure
of a well-farer’s robe for a well-farer.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Well-farer’s robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in length it is nine spans of the accepted span, in breadth six spans.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should have made</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he makes it or causes it to be made, in the business … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc89#Bu-Pc.89">Bu-Pc.89</a></span> … If, having acquired what was made for another, he makes use of it, there is
an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.92.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.92.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if he makes it less; if having acquired what was made for
another, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.174" href="#Vin.4.174"></a>
having cut it clown, he makes use of it; if he makes a canopy … or a
squatting-mat; if he is mad, if he is the first wrongdoer.</p>
<p class="end">The Tenth rule of training: that on Nanda</p>

<h5>This is its key:</h5>
<p>And of a king, treasure, if he be there, <br>
a needle, and a couch, on cotton,<br>
And a piece of cloth to sit upon, <br>
and the itch, for the rains, and on a well-farer.</p>

Venerable ones, recited are the ninety-two rules for offences of expiation.
Concerning them, I ask the venerable ones: I hope that you are quite pure in
this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this
matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter?
The venerable ones are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent,
thus do I understand this. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.175" href="#Vin.4.175"></a></p>
