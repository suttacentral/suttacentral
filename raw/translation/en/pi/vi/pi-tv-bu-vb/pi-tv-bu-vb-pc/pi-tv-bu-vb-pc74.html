… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.146" href="#Vin.4.146"></a>
time the group of six monks, angry, displeased, gave the group of seventeen
monks a blow; these cried out. Monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your reverences,
cry out?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased, gave us a blow.”
Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of
six monks, angry, displeased, give monks a blow?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, angry, displeased, gave monks a
blow?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, angry, displeased, give monks a blow? It is not,
foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should give a monk a blow, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Should give a blow</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he gives a blow with the body or with something attached to the body or with
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.48" href="#BD.3.48"></a>
something that may be cast, and even with a lotus-leaf, there is an offence of
expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that one is ordained when he is ordained, (and) angry, displeased,
gives a blow, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether
one is ordained … If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is ordained,
(and) angry, displeased … offence of expiation. If angry, displeased, he gives
a blow to one who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
thinks that one is ordained when he is not ordained, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether one is not ordained, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is not
ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.74.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.74.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, being in some difficulty, he gives a blow desiring
freedom; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
