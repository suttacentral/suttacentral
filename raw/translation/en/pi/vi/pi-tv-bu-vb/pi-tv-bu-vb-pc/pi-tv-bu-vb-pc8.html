… at Vesālī in the pavilion of the Gabled Hall in the Great Grove. Now at that
time many monks who were friends and companions went for the rains to the banks
of the river Vaggumudā. At that time Vajji was short of alms-food, which was
difficult to obtain; it was suffering from a famine, and food-tickets were
being issued. Nor was it easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour.
Then these monks said to one another:</p>
<p>“At present Vajjī is short of alms-food … Nor is it easy to keep oneself going
by gleaning or by favour. What now if we, by some strategem, all together,
being on friendly terms and harmonious, should spend a comfortable rainy season
and not go short of alms-food?”</p>
<p>Some spoke thus: “Look, your reverences, we could superintend the business of
householders, thus they will think to give to us; thus we, all together, being
on friendly terms and harmonious, will spend a comfortable rainy season and not
go short of alms-food.”</p>
<p>Some spoke thus: “Enough, your reverences, of super-intending the business of
householders. Look, your reverences, we will execute householders’ commissions,
thus they will think to give to us; thus we, all together, being on friendly
terms and harmonious, will spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of
alms-food.”</p>
<p>Some spoke thus: “Enough, your reverences, of super-intending the business of
householders and of executing householders’ commissions. Look, your reverences,
we will speak praise to householders concerning this or that <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.209" href="#BD.2.209"></a>
condition of further-men, saying: ‘Such a monk is possessed of the first
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.24" href="#Vin.4.24"></a>
musing, such a monk is possessed of the second musing, such a monk is possessed
of the third musing, such a monk is possessed of the fourth musing, such a monk
is a stream-attainer, such a monk is a once-returner, such a monk is a
non-returner, such a monk is man perfected, such a monk is a three-fold wisdom
man, such a monk is a sixfold super-knowledge man.’ Thus these (householders)
will think to give to us; thus we, all together, being on friendly terms and
harmonious, will spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of
alms-food. It is better, your reverences, to speak praise to householders
concerning this or that condition of further-men.”</p>
<p>Then these monks spoke praise to householders concerning this or that condition
of further-men, saying, “Such a monk is possessed of the first musing … such a
monk is a sixfold super-knowledge man.” Then these (men) thought: “Surely we
have gained, surely there is a profit for us that such monks have come to us
for the rains. Surely such monks as these monks, virtuous and of good
character, never came to us for the rains before.” Accordingly these did not on
their own account eat meals—they gave not to parents, they gave not to wife and
children, they gave not to slave or servant, they gave not to friend or
colleague, they gave not to blood-relations, as they gave to the monks.
Accordingly these did not on their own account take savoury solid foods or
drinks—they gave not to parents, they gave not to wife and children, they gave
not to slave or servant, they gave not to friend or colleague, they gave not to
blood-relations, as they gave to the monks. Thus these monks became handsome,
of rounded features, their complexions bright, their skins clear.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.8.1.2" href="#Bu-Pc.8.1.2"></a>
Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains to go and
see the lord. Then these monks who had finished keeping the rains, the three
months having elapsed, packing away their bedding <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.210" href="#BD.2.210"></a>
taking their bowls and robes, went up to Vesālī. In the course of time they
came up to Vesālī, the Great Grove, the pavilion of the Gabled Hall, and to the
lord, and having approached the lord, they greeted him and sat down at a
respectful distance. At that time the monks who had spent the rains in those
regions had become lean, wretched, of a bad colour, having become very yellow,
their veins standing out all over their bodies; but the monks from the banks of
the Vaggumudā had become handsome, of rounded features, their complexions
bright, their skins clear. Now it was the custom for enlightened ones, for
lords, to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks. So the lord said to
the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.25" href="#Vin.4.25"></a></p>
<p>“I hope, monks, that things went well with you, I hope that you had enough to
support life, I hope that, all together, being on friendly terms and
harmonious, you spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of
alms-food?”</p>
<p>“Things did go well with us, lord, we had enough to support life, lord, and all
together we, lord, being on friendly terms and harmonious, spent a comfortable
rainy season and did not go short of alms-food.”</p>
<p>Tathāgatas knowing (sometimes) ask; knowing (sometimes) do not ask; they ask,
knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the right time (when not
to ask). Tathāgatas ask about what belongs to the goal, not about what does not
belong to the goal; the breaking of the bridge of the Tathāgatas is among what
does not belong to the goal. Enlightened ones, lords, question monks concerning
two matters, either: “Shall we teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?” or, “Shall we make known a rule of training for disciples?”</p>
<p>Then the lord spoke thus to the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā:</p>
<p>“In what way did you, monks, all together, being on friendly terms and
harmonious, spend a comfortable rainy season and not go short of alms-food?”
Then these monks told this matter to the lord.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.211" href="#BD.2.211"></a>
“Indeed, monks, I wonder if that is a fact?”</p>
<p>“It is a fact, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, monks, for the sake of your stomachs, speak praise to
householders concerning this or that condition of further-men? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this
rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should speak of a condition of further-men to one who is not
ordained—if it is a fact, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
