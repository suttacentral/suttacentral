… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks having entered a village at the wrong time, having sat
down in a hall, talked a variety of worldly talk, that is to say talk of kings,
talk of thieves, talk of great ministers, talk of armies, talk of fears, talk
of battles, talk of food, talk of drink, talk of clothes, talk of beds, talk of
garlands, talk of scents, talk of relations, talk of vehicles, talk of
villages, talk of little towns, talk of towns, talk of the country, talk of
women, talk of strong drink, talk of streets, talk of wells, talk of those
departed before, talk of diversity, speculation about <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.83" href="#BD.3.83"></a>
the world, speculation about the sea, talk on becoming and not becoming thus or
thus. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having entered a village at the
wrong time, having sat down in a hall, talk a variety of worldly talk, that is
to say, talk of kings … talk on becoming and not becoming thus or thus? It is
like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses.”</p>
<p>Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest monks …
spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks, having entered a
village at the wrong time, … talk a variety of worldly talk, that is to say …
talk of becoming and not becoming thus or thus?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, having entered a village at the wrong
time … talked a variety of worldly talk, that is to say … talk of becoming and
not becoming thus or thus?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, having entered a village at the wrong time, … talk a
variety of worldly talk, that is to say … talk of becoming and not becoming
thus or thus? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.84" href="#BD.3.84"></a>
who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be
set forth: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.165" href="#Vin.4.165"></a></p>
<p><span class="subrule">“Whatever monk should enter a village at the wrong time, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

Now at that time several monks, going to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan country,
arrived at a certain village in the evening. People, having seen these monks,
spoke thus: “Enter, honoured sirs.” Then these monks, thinking, “It is
forbidden by the lord to enter a village at the wrong time,” being scrupulous,
did not enter. Thieves robbed these monks. Then these monks, having arrived in
Sāvatthī, told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the
lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given
reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, having asked (for permission), to enter a village at the
wrong time. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">Whatever monk, not having asked (for permission), should enter a village at the
wrong time, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

Now at that time a certain monk, going to Sāvatthī through the Kosalan country,
arrived at a certain village in the evening. People, having seen that monk,
spoke thus: “Enter, honoured sir.” Then that monk, thinking, “It is forbidden
by the lord to enter a village at the wrong time, not having asked (for
permission),” being scrupulous, did not enter. Thieves robbed that monk. Then
that monk, having arrived in Sāvatthī, told this matter to the monks. The monks
told this matter to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.85" href="#BD.3.85"></a>
the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given
reasoned talk, addressed, the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, having asked (for permission) if a monk be there, to enter
a village at the wrong time. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">Whatever monk, not having asked (for permission) if a monk be there, should

Now at that time a certain monk came to be bitten by a snake. A certain monk,
thinking: “I will bring fire,” went to a village. Then that monk, thinking, “It
is forbidden by the lord, not having asked (for permission) if a monk be there,
to enter a village at the wrong time,” being scrupulous, did not enter. They
told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this
connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, if there is some kind of urgent thing to be done, not
having asked (for permission) if a monk be there, to enter a village at the
wrong time. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, not having asked (for permission) if a monk be there, should
enter a village at the wrong time, unless there is some kind of urgent thing to
be done, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">monk is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If a monk be there</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he becomes able to enter having asked (for permission).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">If a monk</span> be not there means:

<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.86" href="#BD.3.86"></a>
<span class="term">The wrong time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">after noon has passed until sunrise.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should enter a village</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he passes beyond the enclosure of a village that is fenced in, there is an
offence of expiation; if he enters the precincts of a village that is not
fenced in, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If he thinks that it is the wrong time when it is the wrong time (and) not
having asked (for permission) if a monk be there, enters a village unless there
is some kind of urgent thing to be done, there is an offence of expiation. If
he is in doubt as to whether it is the wrong time … If he thinks that it is the
right time when it is the wrong time … offence of expiation. If he thinks that
it is the wrong time when it is the right time, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it is the right time, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is the right time when it is the
right time, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.85.5.3" href="#Bu-Pc.85.5.3"></a>
There is no offence if there is some kind of urgent thing to be done; if a monk
be there he enters having asked (for permission); if no monk being there he
enters not having asked (for permission); if he is going into a village; if he
is going to the nuns’ quarters; if he is going to the sleeping-place of
adherents of other sects; if he is going on his way back; if the way is through
a village; if there are accidents; if he is mad, if he is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
