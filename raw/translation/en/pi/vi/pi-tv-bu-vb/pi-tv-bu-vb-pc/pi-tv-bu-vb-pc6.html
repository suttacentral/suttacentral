… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the venerable Anuruddha, going to Sāvatthī through the country of Kosala, in
the evening arrived at a certain village. Now at that time a rest-house in that
village had been made ready by a certain woman. Then the venerable Anuruddha
approached that woman, and having approached he spoke thus to that woman:</p>
<p>“Sister, if it does not inconvenience you, we would stay for one night in the
rest-house.” “Do stay, honoured sir,” she said. But other travellers came up to
that woman, and having come up, they spoke thus to that woman:</p>
<p>“Lady, if it does not inconvenience you, we would stay for one night <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.18" href="#Vin.4.18"></a>
in the rest-house.”</p>
<p>“But this master, the recluse, arrived first. If he allows it, do stay,” she
said.</p>
<p>Then these travellers approached the venerable Anuruddha, and having
approached, they spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>
<p>“If it does not inconvenience you, honoured sir, we would stay for one night in
the rest-house.”</p>
<p>“Do stay, sirs,” he said.</p>
<p>Then that woman, on account of his appearance, fell in love with the venerable
Anuruddha. Then that woman approached the venerable Anuruddha, and having
approached, she spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, the master will not be comfortable, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.199" href="#BD.2.199"></a>
crowded with these people. Honoured sir, it would be good if I were to prepare
a couch within for the master.”</p>
<p>The venerable Anuruddha consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p>Then that woman, having prepared a couch within for the venerable Anuruddha,
having decked herself up in ornaments, smelling of perfumes, approached the
venerable Anuruddha, and having approached she spoke thus to the venerable
Anuruddha:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, the master is beautiful, good to look upon, charming; I also am
beautiful, good to look upon, charming. It were good, honoured sir, if I were
to become the master’s wife.”</p>
<p>When she had spoken thus, the venerable Anuruddha was silent. A second time … A
third time that woman spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, the master is beautiful, good to look upon, charming; I also am
beautiful, good to look upon, charming. Pray, honoured sir, let the master take
me as well as all the wealth.”</p>
<p>A third time the venerable Anuruddha became silent. Then that woman, having
slipped off her outer cloak, walked up and down before the venerable Anuruddha,
then she stood, then she sat down, then she lay down. Then the venerable
Anuruddha, keeping control over (his) faculties, neither so much as looked at
that woman nor addressed her. Then that woman said:</p>
<p>“Indeed it is wonderful, good sir, indeed it is marvellous, good sir, many men
send for me with a hundred or a thousand, but this recluse, being himself
begged by me does not desire to take me as well as all the wealth,” and
dressing in her outer cloak, saluting <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.200" href="#BD.2.200"></a>
the feet of the venerable Anuruddha with her head, she spoke thus to the
venerable Anuruddha:</p>
<p>“Honoured sir, a transgression has overcome me, in that I acted thus, foolish,
misguided, wrong that I was. Honoured sir, let the master acknowledge for me
the transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future.”</p>
<p>“Truly, sister, a transgression overcame you in that you acted thus, foolish,
misguided, wrong that you were. But if you, sister, seeing the transgression as
a transgression, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.19" href="#Vin.4.19"></a>
confess according to the rule, we acknowledge it for you; for, sister, in the
discipline of the noble, this is growth: whoever, seeing a transgression as a
transgression, confesses according to the rule, and attains restraint in the
future.”</p>
<p>Then that woman, at the end of that night, having with her own hands satisfied
and served the venerable Anuruddha with abundant food, both solid and soft,
greeting the venerable Anuruddha when he had eaten and removed his hand from
the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. As she was sitting down at a
respectful distance, the venerable Anuruddha gladdened, roused, pleased,
delighted that woman with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then that woman, gladdened, roused, pleased, delighted by the venerable
Anuruddha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, said to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>
<p>“Excellent, honoured sir, it is excellent, honoured sir; even as one, honoured
sir, would set upright what is overturned, or would uncover what is hidden, or
would point out the way to one who is astray, or would bring out an oil lamp
into the darkness, so that those with eyes could see forms—even so has <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> been explained in many a figure by master Anuruddha. Honoured sir, I myself go
to the lord as refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to the Order of monks; let the master
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.201" href="#BD.2.201"></a>
receive me as a lay-follower from this day forth, so long as life lasts, as one
gone for refuge.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Anuruddha, having gone to Sāvatthī, told this matter to the
monks. Those who were modest monks, looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Anuruddha lie down in a sleeping-place with a woman?”
Then these monks told this matter to the lord …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Anuruddha, lay down in a sleeping-place with
a woman?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” he said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, Anuruddha, lie down in a sleeping-place with a woman? Anuruddha,
it is not for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this
rule of training should be set forth :</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk should lie down in a sleeping-place with a woman, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Woman</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a human woman, not a female <i lang="pi">yakkha</i>, not a female departed one, not a female animal, even a little girl born this
very day, all the more an older one.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">With</span> means:
<span class="gloss">together.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Sleeping-place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if it is fully covered, if it is fully closed round, if it is partially
covered, if it is partially closed round. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.20" href="#Vin.4.20"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should lie down in a sleeping-place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if at sunset a monk lies down when a woman is lying down, there is an offence
of expiation. If a woman lies down when <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.202" href="#BD.2.202"></a>
a monk is lying down, there is an offence of expiation. Or if both lie down
there is an offence of expiation. If getting up, they lie down again, there is
an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.6.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.6.2.2"></a>
If he thinks that it is a woman when it is a woman (and) lies down in a
sleeping-place with (her), there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt
as to whether it is a woman (and) lies down in a sleeping-place with (her),
there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is not a woman when it
is a woman (and) lies down in a sleeping-place with (her), there is an offence
of expiation. If it is half covered, half closed round, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If he lies down in a sleeping-place with a female <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> or with a female departed one or with a eunuch or with a female animal, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is a woman when it is not a
woman, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether it
is not a woman, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not
a woman when it is not a woman, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.6.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.6.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if it is fully covered (but) not fully closed round, if it
is fully closed round (but) not fully covered, if it is partially uncovered,
partially not closed round, if the monk sits down while the woman is lying
down, if the woman sits down while the monk is lying down, or if both sit down;
if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
