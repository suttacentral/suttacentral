… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a cloth for the rains was allowed to monks by the lord. The group of six monks,
thinking: “A cloth for the rains is allowed by the lord,” wore cloths for the
rains that were not of a (proper) measure; they went about trailing (these)
along in front as well as behind. Those who were modest monks … spread it
about, saying: <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bu-vb-pc90#Bu-Pc.90.1">Bu-Pc.90.1</a></span> … “… should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a cloth for the rains is being made for a monk, it must be made to a
(proper) measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in length six spans of the
accepted span, in breadth two and a half spans. In exceeding this (measure),
there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.173" href="#Vin.4.173"></a>
