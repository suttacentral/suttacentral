… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks brought slander against monks for quarrelling, for
disputing, for engaging in contention; hearing of this they were proclaimed for
that and this dissension; hearing of that they were proclaimed for this and
that dissension, so that quarrels that had not arisen arose, and also quarrels
that had arisen rolled on for becoming more, for expansion. Those who were
modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks bring slander against monks for quarrelling,
(so that) hearing of this … they were proclaimed … for expansion.”</p>
<p>Then these monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, brought slander against monks for
quarrelling, (so that) hearing of this … they were proclaimed … for
expansion?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, bring slander against monks for quarrelling, (so
that) hearing of this … they were proclaimed … for expansion. It is not,
foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increase in
those who are pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">In slander by monks, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Slander</span> means:
<span class="gloss">slander comes to be in two ways: making dear or desiring dissension.</span></p>
<p>One brings slander in ten ways: on account of birth and on account of name and
on account of clan and on account of work and on account of craft and on
account of disease and on account of distinguishing mark and on account of
passion and on account of attainment and on account of mode of address.</p>
<p><span class="term">Birth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) birth: low birth and high birth.</span>
<span class="term">Low birth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">birth as (a member of) a despised class, birth as a bamboo-plaiter, birth as a
hunter, birth as a cartwright, birth as a refuse-scavenger</span>—this means low birth.
<span class="term">High birth</span> means:
<span class="gloss">birth as a noble, birth as a brahmin</span>—this means high birth …
<span class="term">Mode of address</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two modes of address: low mode of address and high mode of address.</span>
<span class="term">Low mode of address</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he says, “You are a camel …” … by calling him male and female</span>—this means low mode
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.13" href="#Vin.4.13"></a>
of address.
<span class="term">High mode of address</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he says, “You are learned … a good bourn is to be expected for you”</span>—this means high mode of address.</p>

ox, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.188" href="#BD.2.188"></a>
an ass, an animal, one (destined) for a state of woe, a good bourn is not for
him, but a bad bourn is to be expected for him’,” … saying: “So and so calls

sentence there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>One who is ordained … brings a slander against the one who is ordained, saying:

learned, experienced, wise, clever people, speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, there is no bad bourn for these, but a good bourn is to be expected for
these,’ he does not say anything else, he just says this,” for each sentence
there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>One who is ordained … brings a slander against the one who is ordained, saying:
“So and so says, ‘What now if these are (members of a) despised class,
bamboo-plaiters, hunters, cartwrights, refuse-scavengers?’ he does not say
anything else, he says just this” … “So and so says, ‘What now if these are
learned, experienced, wise, clever people, speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?’ He does not say anything else, he says just this,” for each sentence there
is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>One who is ordained … brings a slander against the one who is ordained, saying:
“So and so says, ‘We are (members of a) despised class’” … So and so says, ‘We
are not learned, experienced, wise, clever people, speakers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, a bad bourn is not for us, but a good bourn is to be expected for us,’ he
does not <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.189" href="#BD.2.189"></a>

wrong-doing.</p>

one who is ordained, hearing of one who is not ordained, brings a slander
against one who is ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If one who is
ordained, hearing of one who is not ordained, brings a slander against the one

There is no offence if he is not making dear, if he is not desiring dissension,
if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
