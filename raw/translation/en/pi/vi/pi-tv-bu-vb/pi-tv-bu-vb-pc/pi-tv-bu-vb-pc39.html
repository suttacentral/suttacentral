… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six monks, having asked for sumptuous foods for themselves, ate
them. People … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having asked for sumptuous foods
for themselves, eat them? Who is not fond of well-cooked things? Who does not
like sweet things?” Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Those who
were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks, having asked for … eat them?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.88" href="#Vin.4.88"></a>
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, having asked for … ate them?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, having asked for … eat them? It is not, foolish men,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of
training should be set forth:</p>
<p>Whatever are sumptuous foods, that is to say, ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey,
molasses, fish, meat, milk, curds—whatever monk, having asked for sumptuous
foods such as these for himself, should eat them, there is an offence of
expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.39.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.39.2.1"></a>
Now at that time monks became ill. Monks, enquiring after the ill ones, spoke
thus to the ill monks:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.342" href="#BD.2.342"></a>
“We hope that your reverences are better, we hope that you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Formerly, your reverences, we, having asked for sumptuous foods for ourselves,
ate them. Therefore there came to be comfort for us. But now it is forbidden by
the lord, and being scrupulous, we do not ask, therefore there comes to be no
comfort for us.”</p>
<p>They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, having
given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, having asked for sumptuous foods for
himself, to eat them. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set
forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever are sumptuous foods, that is to say, ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey,
molasses, fish, meat, milk, curds—whatever monk who is not ill, having asked
for sumptuous foods such as these for himself, should eat them, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.39.3.2" href="#Bu-Pc.39.3.2"></a>
If he thinks that he is not ill when he is not ill, (and) having asked for
sumptuous foods for himself, eats them, there is an offence of expiation. If he
is in doubt as-to whether he is not ill … If he thinks that he is ill when he
is not ill … expiation. If he thinks that he is not ill when he is ill, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he is in doubt as to whether he is ill, there
is an offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ill when he is ill, there
is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.39.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.39.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is ill; if having become ill, having asked, one who
is not ill eats (the alms); if he eats the remainder of an ill (monk’s meal);
if they belong to relations; if they are invited; if it is for the good of
another; if it is by means of his own property; if he is mad, if he is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
