… among the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu at the Banyan monastery. Now at that time
Mahānāma the Sakyan had abundant medicine. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached
the lord, and having approached, having greeted the lord, he sat down at a
respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Mahānāma
the Sakyan spoke thus to the lord:</p>
<p>“I want, lord, to invite the Order (to accept) medicine for four months.”</p>
<p>“Very good, Mahānāma; well then, you, Mahānāma, invite the Order (to accept)
medicine for four months.”</p>
<p>The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent. They told this matter to the
lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to accept an invitation (to accept) a requisite for four
months.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.47.1.2" href="#Bu-Pc.47.1.2"></a>
Then monks asked Mahānāma the Sakyan for a little medicine, (although) Mahānāma
the Sakyan had abundant medicine as before. A second time did Mahānāma the
Sakyan approach the lord … spoke thus to the lord:</p>
<p>“I want, lord, to invite the Order (to accept) medicine for an additional four
months.”</p>
<p>“Very good, Mahānāma; well then, you, Mahānāma, invite the Order (to accept)
medicine for an additional four months.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.369" href="#BD.2.369"></a>
The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent. They told this matter to the
lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to accept a renewed invitation.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.47.1.3" href="#Bu-Pc.47.1.3"></a>
Then monks asked Mahānāma the Sakyan for just a little medicine, (although)
Mahānāma the Sakyan had abundant medicine as before. A third time <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.102" href="#Vin.4.102"></a>
did Mahānāma the Sakyan approach the lord … spoke thus to the lord:</p>
<p>“I want, lord, to invite the Order (to accept) medicine for life.”</p>
<p>“Very good, Mahānāma; well then, you, Mahānāma, invite the Order (to accept)
medicine for life.”</p>
<p>The monks, being scrupulous, did not consent. They told this matter to the
lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to accept a permanent invitation.”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.47.1.4" href="#Bu-Pc.47.1.4"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks had become improperly dressed,
improperly clothed, not decently attired. Mahānāma the Sakyan became a
speaker:</p>
<p>“Why are you, honoured sirs, improperly dressed, improperly clothed, not
decently attired? On going forth, should not one become properly dressed,
properly clothed, decently attired?”</p>
<p>The group of six monks grumbled at Mahānāma the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.370" href="#BD.2.370"></a>
Sakyan. Then it occurred to the group of six monks: “Now, in what way could we
bring shame to Mahānāma the Sakyan?” Then it occurred to the group of six
monks: “The Order is invited by Mahānāma the Sakyan (to accept) medicine. Come,
your reverences, let us ask Mahānāma the Sakyan for ghee.” Then the group of
six monks approached Mahānāma the Sakyan, and having approached they spoke thus
to Mahānāma the Sakyan:</p>
<p>“Sir, we want a <i lang="pi">doṇa</i> measure of ghee.”</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, wait this day (only); people are going to the cattle-pen to get
ghee; you may fetch it in the morning.”</p>
<p>A second time … A third time did the group of six monks speak thus: … “… in the
morning.”</p>
<p>“Do you, sir, not give what you invited (us to accept) because you do not
desire to give what you invited (us to accept)?”</p>
<p>Then Mahānāma the Sakyan looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these revered sirs, being told: ‘Wait this day (only), honoured sirs,’
not wait?”</p>
<p>Monks heard Mahānāma the Sakyan as he … spread it about. Those who were modest
monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can this group of six monks being told by Mahānāma the Sakyan, ‘Wait this
day (only), honoured sirs,’ not wait?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, being told … did not wait?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, being told by Mahānāma the Sakyan … not wait? It is
not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus,
monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">When a monk is not ill, an invitation (to accept) a
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.371" href="#BD.2.371"></a>
requisite for four months may be accepted,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.103" href="#Vin.4.103"></a>
unless there be a renewed invitation, unless there be a permanent invitation.
If one should accept for longer than that, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.47.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.47.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.47.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">When a monk is not ill, an invitation (to accept) a requisite for four months
may be accepted</span> means:
<span class="gloss">an invitation (to accept) a requisite may be accepted by one who is ill.</span></p>
<p>And a
<span class="term">renewed invitation</span> may be accepted means:
<span class="gloss">if he thinks, ‘When I become ill, then I will ask.’</span></p>
<p>And a
<span class="term">permanent invitation</span> may be accepted means:
<span class="gloss">if he thinks, ‘When I become ill, then I will ask.’</span></p>
<p>If
<span class="term">one should accept for longer than that</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there is an invitation limited to medicines, not limited to nights; there is an
invitation limited to nights, not limited to medicines; there is an invitation
limited to medicines and limited to nights; there is an invitation neither
limited to medicines nor limited to nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Limited to medicines</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he says, “I invite (them to accept) just these medicines,” medicines come to
be taken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Limited to nights</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he says, “I invite (them to accept) on just these nights,” nights come to be
taken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Limited to medicines and limited to nights</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he says, “I invite (them to accept) just these medicines on just these
nights,” medicines come to be taken up and nights come to be taken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Neither limited to medicines nor limited to nights</span> means:
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.372" href="#BD.2.372"></a>
<span class="gloss">there come to be medicines that are not taken up and there come to be nights
that are not taken up.</span></p>
<p>In “limited to medicines,” if, setting aside those medicines which he came to
be invited (to accept), he asks for other medicines, there is an offence of
expiation. In “limited to nights,” if, setting aside those nights for which he
came to be invited (to accept), he asks for other nights, there is an offence
of expiation. In “limited to medicines and limited to nights,” if setting aside
those medicines which he came to be invited (to accept), if setting aside those
nights for which he came to be invited (to accept), he asks for other medicines
for other nights, there is an offence of expiation. In “neither limited to
medicines nor limited to nights” there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.47.2.2" href="#Bu-Pc.47.2.2"></a>
If he asks for medicine that is not to be used as medicine, there is an offence
of expiation. If he asks for one medicine that may be used as a different
medicine, there is an offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is for longer
than that when it is for longer than that (and) asks for medicine, there is an
offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to whether it is for longer than
that … If he thinks that it is not for longer than that -when it is for longer
than that … offence of expiation. If he thinks that it is for longer than that
when it is not for longer than that, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If he
is in doubt as to whether it is not for longer than that, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that it is not for longer than that when it is not
for longer than that, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.47.2.3" href="#Bu-Pc.47.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if he asks for those medicines which he came to be invited
(to accept); if he asks for <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.373" href="#BD.2.373"></a>
those nights for which he came to be invited (to accept); if he asks,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.104" href="#Vin.4.104"></a>
explaining, ‘Of those medicines which we were invited by you (to accept) we
need this and that medicine’; if he asks, explaining, ‘Those nights for which
we were invited by you have passed and we need medicine’; if they belong to
relations; if they are invited; if it is for the sake of another; if it is by
means of his own property; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
