… was staying in the Bhagga country at Crocodile Hill in Bhesakala grove in the
deer-park. Now at that time monks, kindling in the winter time a fire of large
hollow logs, warmed themselves. And in that hollow a dark poisonous snake was
scorched by the fire; issuing forth, he pursued the monks. The monks ran about
here and there. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised,
spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these monks, kindling a fire, warm themselves?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, kindling a fire, warmed yourselves?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can these foolish men, kindling a fire, warm themselves? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks,
this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">Whatever monk, desirous of warming himself, should kindle or should cause a
fire to be kindled, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.399" href="#BD.2.399"></a>
And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.56.1.2" href="#Bu-Pc.56.1.2"></a>
Now at that time monks became ill. Monks, inquiring after the ill ones, spoke
thus to the ill monks: “We hope that your reverences are better, we hope that
you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Formerly, your reverences, we, kindling a fire, used to warm ourselves; thus
there came to be comfort for us. But now it is forbidden by the lord, (and)
being scrupulous, we do not warm ourselves; thus there comes to be no comfort
for us.”</p>
<p>They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, when a monk is ill, kindling or causing a fire to be
kindled, to warm yourselves. And thus, monks, this rule of training should be
set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="subrule">Whatever monk, not being ill, desirous of warming himself, should kindle <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.116" href="#Vin.4.116"></a>
or should cause a fire to be kindled, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for monks came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bu-Pc.56.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.56.2.1" href="#Bu-Pc.56.2.1"></a>
Now at that time monks, being scrupulous, did not light a lamp in the fire-room
or in the bath-room. They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to kindle or to cause a fire to be kindled when there is a
sufficient reason for it. And thus … should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever monk, not being ill, desirous of warming himself, should kindle or
should cause a fire to be kindled, unless there is sufficient reason for it,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="gloss">… is monk to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.400" href="#BD.2.400"></a>
<span class="term">Not being ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he for whom there comes to be comfort without a fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Ill</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he for whom there does not come to be comfort without a fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Desirous of warming himself</span> means:
<span class="gloss">wishing to heat himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A fire</span> means:
<span class="gloss">what is called a fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should kindle</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he himself kindles, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should cause to be kindled</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if he commands another, there is an offence of expiation. When once commanded,
if he kindles much, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Unless there is a sufficient reason for it</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside a sufficient reason for it.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.56.3.2" href="#Bu-Pc.56.3.2"></a>
If he thinks that he is not ill when he is not ill, (and) desirous of warming
himself, kindles or causes a fire to be kindled, unless there is a sufficient
reason for it, there is an offence of expiation. If he is in doubt as to
whether he is not ill … If he thinks that he is ill when he is not ill …
offence of expiation. If he picks up a fallen fire-brand, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is not ill when he is ill, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If he thinks that he is ill when he is ill, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.56.3.3" href="#Bu-Pc.56.3.3"></a>
There is no offence if he is ill; if he warms himself at one made by another;
if he warms himself over raked-out embers; if at a lamp, in a fire-room, in a
bath-room; if there is a sufficient reason for it; if there are dangers; if he
is mad; if he is the first wrong-doer.</p>
