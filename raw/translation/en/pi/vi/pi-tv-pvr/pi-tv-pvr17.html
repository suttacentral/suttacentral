At that time the Buddha, the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove
in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the venerable Upāli approached the Lord;
having approached and greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance. As
he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Upāli spoke thus to
the Lord, “Possessed of how many qualities, revered sir, should a monk not live
independently for as long as life lasts?”</p>

“In how many ways, revered sir, is an Order split?”</p>
<p>“In five ways, Upāli, is an Order split. In what five? By a formal act, by a
recitation, by talking, by proclamation, by offering a voting ticket. These,
Upāli, are the five ways in which an Order is split.”</p>

“Revered sir, as to the words: Dissension in an Order, dissension in an
Order—to what extent, revered sir, is there dissension in an Order but not
schism in an Order? And to what extent is there dissension in an Order as well
as schism in an Order?”</p>
<p>“This observance for incoming monks, Upāli, was laid down by me for incoming
monks. The rules of training having been properly laid down by me thus, Upāli,
if incoming monks do not observe the observance for incoming (monks)—thus,
Upāli, is there dissension in an Order but not schism in an Order. This
observance for resident (monks), Upāli, was laid down by me for resident monks.
The rules of training having been properly laid down by me thus, Upāli, if
resident monks do not observe the observance for resident (monks)—thus, Upāli,
is there dissension in an Order but not schism in an Order.</p>
<p>This observance for a refectory, Upāli, was laid down by me for monks in
respect of a refectory: the best seat, the best water (for washing), the best
alms according to seniority, according to (the time of) night, according as it
is befitting. The rules of training having been properly laid down by me thus,
Upāli, if newly ordained monks reserve a seat in the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.324" href="#BD.6.324"></a>
refectory for monks who are Elders—thus, Upāli, is there dissension in an Order
but not schism in an Order.</p>
<p>This observance in respect of lodgings, Upāli, was laid down by me for monks in
respect of lodgings according to seniority according to (the time of) night,
according as it is befitting. The rules of training having been properly laid
down by me thus, Upāli, if newly ordained monks reserve lodgings for monks who
are Elders—thus, Upāli, is there dissension in an Order but not schism in an
Order.</p>
<p>This was laid down by me, Upāli, for monks inside a boundary: one Observance,
one Invitation, one formal act of the Order, one set of formal acts. The rules
of training having been properly laid down by me thus, Upāli, if, having made a
separate arrangement just there inside a boundary and having split off a group,
they carry out a separate Observance and carry out a separate Invitation <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.202" href="#Vin.5.202"></a>
and carry out a separate formal act of the Order and carry out a separate set
of formal acts—thus, Upāli, is there dissension in an Order as well as schism
in an Order.”</p>
