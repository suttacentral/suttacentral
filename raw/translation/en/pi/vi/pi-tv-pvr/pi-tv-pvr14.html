When a monk who is engaged in conflict is approaching an Order he should
approach the Order with a humble mind, with a mind as though (it were) removing
dust. He should be skilled about seats and skilled about sitting down. He
should sit down on a suitable seat without encroaching on (the space intended
for) monks who are Elders and without keeping newly ordained monks from a seat.
He should not talk in a desultory fashion, nor about inferior (worldly)
matters. Either he should speak <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> himself or should ask another to do so, or he should not disdain the <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> silence. A preceptor should not be asked about by an Order, by an approved
individual, by an adjudicator, by one anxious to adjudicate; a teacher should
not be asked about, one who shares a cell … a pupil … a fellow-preceptor … a
fellow-teacher should not be asked about; birth should not be asked about, name
… clan … the (scriptural) tradition … the family’s standing … the native
district should not be asked about. What is the reason for that? In case there
were regard or hatred for it. If there were regard or hatred he might follow (a
wrong course) from partiality … hatred … confusion, he might follow (a wrong
course) from fear. There should be respect for an Order, for an approved
individual, for an adjudicator, for one anxious to adjudicate, not respect for
an individual. There should be <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.265" href="#BD.6.265"></a>
respect for True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>, not respect for the material things of the world. There should be pursuit of
the goal, not conformity to an assembly. One should adjudicate at a right time,
not at a wrong time; one should adjudicate about what is fact, not about what
is not fact; one should adjudicate gently, not harshly; one should adjudicate
about what is connected with the goal, not about what is not connected with the
goal; one should adjudicate with a mind of loving-kindness, not with inner
hatred.</p>
<p>There should not be murmuring in his ear, he should not seek what is crooked,
he should not cover his eye, he should not raise his eye-brow, he should not
raise his head, he should not make a movement with his hand, he should not give
a gesture with the hand. He should be skilled about seats, he should be skilled
about sitting down; looking a plough’s length ahead, pursuing the goal he
should sit down on his own seat and should not rise from the seat, he should
not pass beyond (the judgement), he should not follow a wrong way; he should
not speak waving his arms about, he should be unhastening, he should be
considerate, he should not be quick tempered, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.164" href="#Vin.5.164"></a>
with a mind of loving-kindness he should be gentle in speech; merciful, he
should be compassionate for welfare; seeking for welfare, he should not be
frivolous in speech; limiting his speech, he should be one who masters
hostility, and is without irascibility.</p>
<p>The self must be assessed, the other must be assessed, the reprover must be
assessed, the reproved must be assessed, one who reproves not by rule … one who
is reproved not by rule … one who reproves by rule … one who is reproved by
rule must be assessed. Without omitting what was said, not bringing forward
what was not said, having properly learnt the words and sentences as given,
questioning the other in <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.266" href="#BD.6.266"></a>
return, he should deal with him according to his acknowledgement. An indolent
person should be roused, a fearful one given confidence, a violent one checked,
an impure one put right, a straight one (treated) with mildness. He should not
follow a wrong course from partiality … hatred … confusion … fear. He should be
balanced as to the rules and the individuals. Thus is an adjudicator when he
adjudicates thus both a doer of the Teacher’s Dispensation, and is dear to
learned men and to his fellow Brahma-farers and liked by them and he is
esteemed and to be respected.</p>

A clause is for the sake of reference, a simile is for the sake of
illustration, a meaning is for the sake of instruction, a question (asked) in
return is for the sake of setting aside, giving leave is for the sake of
reproving, reproving is for the sake of making remember, making remember is for
the sake of commands, a command is for the sake of impediments, an impediment
is for the sake of investigating, investigating is for the sake of a decision,
a decision is for the sake of referring to a possibility and what is not a
possibility, referring to a possibility and what is not a possibility is for
the sake of restraint of evil-minded individuals and for the sake of the
support of well behaved monks; the Order is for the sake of agreement and
acceptance; individuals approved of by the Order are <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.267" href="#BD.6.267"></a>
persevering by themselves, are persevering in being trustworthy; discipline is
for the sake of restraint, restraint is for the sake of not being remorseful,
not being remorseful is for the sake of joy, joy is for the sake of delight,
delight is for the sake of tranquillity, tranquillity is for the sake of
happiness, happiness is for the sake of concentration, concentration is for the
sake of knowledge and vision of what has come to be as it really-is, knowledge
and vision of what has come to be as it really is is for the sake of turning
away, turning away is for the sake of dispassion, dispassion is for the sake of
freedom, freedom is for the sake of the knowledge and vision of freedom, the
knowledge and vision of freedom is for the sake of final <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i> without clinging. According to this meaning is the talk. According to this
meaning is the counsel. According to this meaning is the causal relation.
According to this meaning is the lending ear, that is to say the deliverance of
mind without clinging.</p>
