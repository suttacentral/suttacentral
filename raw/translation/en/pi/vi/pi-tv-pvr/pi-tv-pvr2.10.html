Because of consenting to physical contact how many offences does she fall into?
Because of consenting to physical contact she falls into five offences. If a
nun filled with desire, consents to taking hold of a man who is filled with
desire below the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees, there is an
offence involving Defeat. If a monk rubs (her) body with (his) body the offence
is one requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order. If she rubs something attached
to the body with the body there is a grave offence. If she rubs something
attached to the body with something attached to the body there is an offence of
wrong-doing. In tickling with the fingers there is an offence of Expiation.

offences. If a nun knowingly conceals a matter involving Defeat the offence is

offence. If a monk conceals an offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order
there is an offence of Expiation; if she conceals a falling away from good
behaviour there is an offence of wrong-doing. Because of concealing a fault she
falls into these four offences.</p>
