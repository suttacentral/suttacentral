Four legal questions: a legal question concerning disputes, a legal question
concerning censure, a legal question concerning offences, a legal question
concerning obligations These are the four legal questions. Of these four legal
questions how many openings up are there? Of these four legal questions there
are ten openings up. Of a legal question concerning disputes there are two
openings up. Of a legal question concerning censure there are four openings up.
Of a legal question concerning offences there are three openings up. Of a legal
question concerning obligations there is one opening up. These are the ten
openings up of these four legal questions. In opening up a legal question
concerning disputes … censure offences … obligations, how many decidings does
one open up? In opening up a legal question concerning disputes one opens up
two decidings. In opening up a legal question concerning censure one opens up
four decidings. In opening up a legal question concerning offences one opens up
three decidings. In opening up a legal question concerning obligations one
opens up one deciding.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.11.1.2" href="#Prv.11.1.2"></a>
How many openings up? In how many ways does one bring about an opening up? Of
how many qualities is an individual who opens up a legal question possessed?
How many individuals, in opening up a legal question, fall into an offence?</p>
<p>Twelve openings up. In ten ways does one bring about an opening up. An
individual who is possessed of four qualities opens up a legal question. Four
individuals in opening up a legal question fall into an offence.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.11.1.3" href="#Prv.11.1.3"></a>
What are the twelve openings up? Saying: The formal act is not carried out, the
formal act is badly carried out, the formal act should be carried out again; it
is not fixed, it is badly fixed, it should be fixed again; it is not decided,
it is <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.245" href="#BD.6.245"></a>
badly decided, it should be decided again; it is not settled, it is badly
settled, it should be settled again—these twelve openings up.</p>
<p>In what ten ways does one bring about an opening up? He opens up a legal
question where it arose; he opens up a legal question settled where it arose;
he opens up a legal question on a highway; he opens up a legal question settled
on a highway; he opens up a legal question when he has arrived there; he opens
up a legal question settled when he has arrived there; he opens up a verdict of
innocence; he opens up a verdict of past insanity; <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.151" href="#Vin.5.151"></a>
he opens up a decision for specific depravity; he opens up a covering over (as)
with grass. In these ten ways one brings about an opening up.</p>
<p>Of what four qualities is an individual possessed that he opens up a legal
question? Following a wrong course through partiality … hatred … confusion …
fear he opens up a legal question. Possessed of these four qualities an
individual opens up a legal question.</p>
<p>Who are the four individuals who in opening up a legal question fall into an
offence? If one who was ordained that very day opens (it) up, for opening up
there is an offence of Expiation. If an incoming monk … if one who carried out
(the legal question) … if one who has given his consent opens (it) up, for
opening up there is an offence of Expiation. These four individuals, in opening
up, fall into an offence.</p>

Of the four legal questions what are the thirty-three origins? The eighteen
matters making for schism are the origins of a legal question concerning
disputes. The four fallings away are the origins of a legal question concerning
censure. The seven classes of offence are the origins of a legal question
concerning offences. The four (formal) acts are the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.247" href="#BD.6.247"></a>
origins of a legal question concerning obligations. These are the thirty-three
origins of the four legal questions.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.11.1.8" href="#Prv.11.1.8"></a>
Is a legal question concerning disputes an offence or not an offence? A legal
question concerning disputes is not an offence—could one then fall into an
offence because of a legal question concerning disputes? Yes, one could fall
into an offence because of a legal question concerning disputes. How many
offences does one fall into because of a legal question concerning disputes?
One falls into two offences because of a legal question concerning disputes: if
he insults one who is ordained there is an offence of Expiation; if he insults
one who is not ordained there is an offence of wrong-doing. These are the two
offences one falls into because of a legal question concerning disputes.</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away, to how many fallings away do these offences
appertain? Of the four legal questions which legal question? Of the seven
classes of offence in how many classes of offence are they comprised? Of the
six origins of offences by how many origins do they originate? By how many
legal questions, among how many possibilities, by how many decidings are they
stopped?</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away these offences appertain to one falling away: falling
away from right behaviour. Of the four legal questions the legal question
concerning offences. Of the seven classes of offence they are comprised in two
classes of offence: it may be in the class of offence of Expiation; it may be
in the class of offence of wrong-doing. Of the six origins of offences they
originate by three origins. By one legal question: by the legal question
concerning obligations; by three possibilities: in the midst of an Order, in
the midst of a group, in the presence of an individual; by three decidings are
they stopped: it may be by a verdict in the presence of and by the carrying out
on his acknowledgement; it may be by a verdict in the Presence of and by a
covering over (as) with grass.</p>

Is a legal question concerning censure an offence or not an offence …
<span class="add">

<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-pvr11#Prv.11.1.8">Prv.11.1.8</a></span> … One falls into three offences because of
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.248" href="#BD.6.248"></a>
a legal question concerning censure: if he defames a monk with an unfounded
charge of an offence involving Defeat there is an offence requiring a Formal
Meeting of the Order; if he defames with an unfounded charge of an offence
requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order there is an offence of Expiation; if he
defames with an unfounded charge of falling away from right behaviour there is
an offence of wrong-doing. These are the three offences one falls into because
of a legal question concerning censure.</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away, to how many … by how many decidings are they
stopped?</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away these offences appertain to two fallings away: it may
be to falling away from moral habit; it may be to falling away from right
behaviour. Of the four legal questions, the legal question <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.153" href="#Vin.5.153"></a>
concerning offences. Of the seven classes of offence they are comprised in
three classes of offence: it may be in the class of offence requiring a Formal
Meeting of the Order; it may be in the class of offence of Expiation; it may be
in the class of offence of wrong-doing. Of the six origins of offence they
originate by three origins. That which is a serious offence is an offence that
is stopped by one legal question: the legal question concerning obligations; by
one possibility: in the midst of the Order; by two decidings: by a verdict in
the presence of and by the carrying out on his acknowledgement. Those which are
slight offences are offences that are stopped by one legal question: the legal
question concerning obligations; by three possibilities … <span class="add">

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.11.1.10" href="#Prv.11.1.10"></a>
Is a legal question concerning offences an offence or not an offence? A legal
question concerning offences is an offence—one could then fall into four
offences because of a legal question concerning offences: if a nun knowingly
conceals an offence involving Defeat there is an offence involving Defeat; if,
being in doubt, she conceals it, there is a grave offence; if a monk conceals
an offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order there is an offence of
Expiation; if one conceals a falling away from good behaviour there is an
offence of wrong-doing. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.249" href="#BD.6.249"></a>
One falls into these four offences because of a legal question concerning
offences.</p>

involving Defeat; it may be in the class of offence that is grave; it may be in
the class of offence of Expiation; it may be in the class of offence of
wrong-doing. Of the six origins of offences they originate by one origin: they
originate by body and speech and thought. That offence which cannot be done
away with is an offence that is not stopped by any legal, question, by any
possibility, by any deciding. Those which are slight offences are offences that
are stopped by one legal question: … <span class="add">

<span class="add">
<em>see</em>
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-pvr11#Prv.11.1.8">Prv.11.1.8</a></span> … One falls into five offences because of a legal question concerning
obligations: if a nun who is an imitator of (a monk) who is suspended, though
being admonished up to the third time, does not give up (her course), there is
an offence of wrong-doing as a result of the motion, a grave offence as a
result of two resolutions, at the end of the resolutions there is an offence
involving Defeat; if imitators of a schismatic, though being admonished up to
the third time, do not give up (their course), there is an offence entailing a
Formal Meeting of the Order; if they do not give up pernicious views, though
being admonished up to the third time, there is an offence of Expiation. One
falls into these five offences because of a legal question concerning
obligations.</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away, to how many … by how many decidings are they

which cannot be done away with is an offence that is not stopped by any legal
question, by any possibility, by any deciding. That which is a serious offence
is an offence that is stopped by one legal question: the legal question arising
out of obligations: by one possibility: in the midst of an Order; by two
