<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.4.1.13" href="#Prv.4.1.13"></a>
Herein what are the six roots of disputes? As to this a monk becomes angry and
bears ill-will. Whatever monk becomes angry and bears ill-will, he lives
without deference, disrespectful towards the Teacher … <span class="add">=
<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd14#Kd.14.14.3">Kd.14.14.3</a>
<em>down to the end of that paragraph</em>.
<em>The word</em> monk
<em>is here constantly omitted</em></span> … thus there come to be no future effects of that evil root of disputes—these

…—these are the six roots of censure.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.4.1.15" href="#Prv.4.1.15"></a>
Herein what are the six things to be remembered? As to this, a monk should
offer his fellow Brahma-farers a friendly act of body both in public and in
private. This is a thing to be remembered making for affection, making for
respect, it conduces to concord, to lack of dispute, to harmony, to unity. And
again a monk should offer … a friendly act of speech … a friendly act of
thought … to unity. And again, whatever are those lawful acquisitions, lawfully
acquired, if they be even but what is put into the begging bowl—a monk should
be one to enjoy sharing such acquisitions, to enjoy them in common with his
virtuous fellow Brahma-farers. This too is a thing to be remembered … to unity.
And again, whatever are those moral habits that are faultless, without flaw,
spotless, without blemish, freeing, praised by wise men, untarnished, conducive
to concentration—<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.93" href="#Vin.5.93"></a>
a monk should dwell united in virtues such as these with his fellow
Brahma-farers, both in public and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.135" href="#BD.6.135"></a>
in private. This too is a thing to be remembered … to unity. And again,
whatever view is ariyan, leading onwards, leading him who acts according to it
to the complete destruction of anguish—a monk should dwell united in a view
such as this with his fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private. This
too is a thing to be remembered … to unity.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.4.1.16" href="#Prv.4.1.16"></a>
Herein what are the eighteen matters making for schism? As to this, a monk
explains non-<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> …
<span class="add">= <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-kd10#Kd.10.5.4">Kd.10.5.4</a></span> … he explains not a very bad offence as a very bad offence—these are the
eighteen matters making for schism.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.4.1.17" href="#Prv.4.1.17"></a>
Herein what are the four legal questions? A legal question concerning disputes,
a legal question concerning censure, a legal question concerning offences, a
legal question concerning obligations—these are the four legal questions.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.4.1.18" href="#Prv.4.1.18"></a>
Herein what are the seven decidings? A verdict in the presence of, a verdict of
innocence, a verdict of past insanity, a carrying out on (his) acknowledgement,
a decision of the majority, a decision for specific depravity, a covering over
(as) with grass—these are the seven decidings.</p>

How many offences does one fall into by means of the first origin of offences?
One falls into five offences by means of the first origin of offences. A monk,
thinking it is allowable, begging; himself, builds a hut without the site being
marked out, exceeding the measure, involving destruction, not with an open
space round it; in the action there is an offence of wrong-doing; if one lump
is still to come there is a grave offence; when that lump has come there is an
offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order. A monk, thinking it is
allowable, eats a meal at a wrong time—there is an offence of Expiation. A
monk, thinking it is allowable, eats solid food or soft food, having accepted
it with his own hand from the hand of nun who is not a relation (and) has
entered among the houses—there is an offence to be Confessed. One falls into
these five offences by means of the first origin of offences.</p>
<p>Of the four fallings away how many fallings away do these <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.137" href="#BD.6.137"></a>

offence are they comprised? Of the six origins of offences by how many origins
do they originate? Of the four legal questions which legal question? Of the
seven decidings by how many decidings are they stopped? Of the four fallings
away these offences appertain to two fallings away: it may be to falling away
from moral habit, it may be to falling away from good behaviour. Of the seven
classes of offence they are comprised in five classes of offence: it may be in
the class of offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order; it may be in the
class of offence that is a grave one; it may be in the class of offence of
Expiation; it may be in the class of offence to be Confessed; it may be in the
class of offence of wrong-doing. Of the six origins of offences they originate
by means of one origin: they originate by body, not by speech, not by mind. Of
the four legal questions the legal question concerning offences. Of the seven
decidings they are stopped by three decidings: it may be by a verdict in the
presence of and by the carrying out on (his) acknowledgement; it may be by a
verdict in the presence of and by a covering over (as) with grass.</p>

How many offences does one fall into by means of the second origin of offences?

“Build a hut for me”. If they build a hut for him, the site not having been
marked out, exceeding the measure, involving destruction, not with an open
space round it, in the action there is an offence of wrong-doing; if one lump
is still to come there is a grave offence; when that lump has come there is an
offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order. A monk, thinking it is
allowable, makes someone who is not ordained teach <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> line by line, there is an offence of Expiation. One falls into these four

not having been marked out, exceeding the measure, involving destruction, not
with an open space round it; in the action there is an offence of wrong-doing;

Because of falling away from moral habit how many offences does one fall into?
Because of falling away from moral habit one falls into four offences: a nun
who knowing of a matter involving Defeat conceals it, falls into an offence
involving Defeat; if, being in doubt, she conceals it, she falls into a grave
offence. If a monk conceals an offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order
he falls into an offence of Expiation. If he conceals his own very bad offence
he falls into an offence of wrong-doing. Because of falling away from moral
habit one falls into these four offences. Of the four fallings away how many
fallings away do these offences appertain to … are they stopped? Of the four
fallings away these offences appertain to two fallings away: it may be to
falling away from moral habit; it may be to falling away from good behaviour.
Of the seven classes of offence they are comprised in four classes of offence:
it may be in the class of offence involving Defeat; it may be in the class of
offence that <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.143" href="#BD.6.143"></a>
is a grave one; it may be in the class of offence of Expiation; it may be in
