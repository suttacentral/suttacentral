Founded on ten reasons a rule of training is laid down by the Tathāgata for
disciples:</p>
<ol>
<li>for the excellence of the Order,</li>
<li>for the comfort of the Order,</li>
<li>for the restraint of evil minded individuals,</li>
<li>for the living in comfort of well behaved monks,</li>
<li>for the control of the cankers belonging to the here-now,</li>
<li>for the combating of the cankers belonging to a future state,</li>
<li>for the benefit of non-believers,</li>
<li>for the increase in the number of believers,</li>
<li>for the maintenance of True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>,</li>
<li>for the furthering of Discipline.</li>
</ol>
<p>That which is the excellence of the Order is the comfort of the Order. That
which is the comfort of the Order is for the restraint of evil minded
individuals. That which is for the restraint of evil minded individuals is for
the living in comfort of well behaved monks … That which is for the maintenance
of True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> is for the furthering of Discipline.</p>
<p>That which is the excellence of the Order is the comfort of the Order. That
which is the excellence of the Order is for the restraint of evil minded
individuals … That which is the excellence of the Order is for the furthering
of Discipline.</p>
<p>That which is the comfort of the Order is for the restraint of evil minded
individuals … That which is the comfort of the Order is for the furthering of
Discipline.</p>
<p>That which is the comfort of the Order is the excellence of the Order …</p>
<p>That which is for the furthering of Discipline is the excellence of the Order …
That which is for the furthering of Discipline is for the maintenance of True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>.</p>
