can it be? There are two decidings of a legal question concerning disputes,
four decidings of a legal question concerning censure, three decidings of a
legal question concerning offences, one deciding of a legal question concerning
obligations. Thus these seven decidings become ten decidings, the ten decidings
become seven decidings according to the presentation of the matter.</p>

How many decidings of a legal question concerning disputes are in common, how
many decidings of a legal question concerning disputes are not in common? How
many decidings of a legal question concerning censure … concerning offences …

<p>Two decidings of a legal question concerning disputes are in common: a verdict

Are decidings of a deciding in common, are decidings of a deciding not in

decidings of a deciding are not in common.</p>
<p>How may it be that decidings of a deciding are in common, how may it be that
decidings of a deciding are not in common.</p>
<p>The decision of the majority is in common with a verdict in the presence of; it

<p>A verdict of innocence is in common with a verdict in the presence of; it is
not in common with a verdict of past insanity, a carrying out on (his)

<p>A verdict of past insanity is in common with a verdict in the presence of; it

How may it be that decidings are stopped by decidings, how may it be that

it is not stopped by a verdict of past insanity … by a carrying out on (his)

<p>How may it be that decidings are stopped by legal questions, how may it be that
decidings are not stopped by legal questions? A verdict in the presence of is
stopped by a legal question concerning disputes; it is not stopped by a legal

concerning obligations. A decision of the majority is stopped by a legal
question concerning disputes; it is not stopped by a legal question concerning
censure … offences … obligations. A verdict of innocence is not stopped by a

A legal question concerning disputes is stopped by a verdict in the presence of
and by a decision of the majority; it is stopped by a verdict of innocence nor
by a verdict for past insanity nor by a carrying out on (his) acknowledgement
nor b a decision for specific depravity nor by a covering over (as) with grass.
A legal question concerning censure is stopped by a verdict in the presence of

decision for specific depravity; it is not stopped by a decision of the
majority nor by a carrying out on (his) acknowledgement nor by a covering over

there may be legal questions that are not stopped by decidings.</p>
<p>How may it be that legal questions are stopped by legal questions, how may it
be that legal questions are not stopped by legal questions? A legal question
concerning disputes is not stopped by a legal question concerning censure, it

legal question concerning offences … a legal question concerning obligations is
not stopped by a legal question concerning disputes, it is not stopped by a

Thus there may be legal questions that are stopped by legal questions, thus
there may be legal questions that are not stopped by legal questions.</p>
