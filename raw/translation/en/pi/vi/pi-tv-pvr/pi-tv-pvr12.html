<p>“For what purpose is reproving, <br>
by reason of what is there making remember,<br>
For what purpose is the Order,<br>
but by reason of what is there an act of Understanding?”</p>
<p>“Reproving is for making remember,<br>
for restraint is making remember,<br>
The Order is for discerning, <br>
but an act of understanding is individual.</p>
<p>“Do not speak quickly,<br>
do not speak angrily,<br>
Do not arouse resentment <br>
if you would be an adjudicator.</p>
<p>“Do not in haste speak challenging talk <br>
unconnected with the meaning<br>
In Sutta, in Discipline, in Parivāra, <br>
in what is laid down, in the principal authorities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.256" href="#BD.6.256"></a>
“Be careful of the proper procedure <br>
that was done with skill by him of discernment,<br>
Of what was well spoken <br>
in conformity with the rules of training,<br>
not destroying a bourn in a future state.</p>
<p>“Seeking for welfare, be intent during (that) time <br>
on what is connected with the goal.<br>
Consider not in haste the mode of speech <br>
of the reproved or the reprover.</p>
<p>“If the reprover says he has fallen, <br>
if he who is being reproved says he has not fallen—<br>
Both, proceeding, should be dealt with <br>
according to (their) acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“Acknowledgement is carried out among the conscientious,<br>
it exists not among the unconscientious;<br>
Though many unconscientious (monks) may say,<br>
‘It should be carried out according to what has been said’.”</p>
<p>“Of what kind is an unconscientious one <br>
for whom acknowledgement is not Effective?<br>
Thus I ask you this: <br>
What is the kind called an unconscientious individual?”</p>
<p>“He falls into an offence intentionally,<br>
he hides the offence,<br>
And goes following a wrong course: <br>
this is the kind called an unconscientious individual.”</p>
<p>“‘I too know the truth’—<br>
this is the kind called unconscientious individual.<br>
And I am asking you another: <br>
what is the kind called a conscientious individual?”</p>
<p>“He does not fall into an offence intentionally,<br>
he does not hide an offence,<br>
He does not go following a wrong course: <br>
this is the kind called a conscientious individual.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.257" href="#BD.6.257"></a>
“‘I too know the truth’—<br>
this is the kind called a conscientious individual. <br>
And I am asking you another: <br>
what is the kind called one who reproves <br>
according to what is not the rule?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.159" href="#Vin.5.159"></a>
“He reproves at a wrong time,<br>
about what is not fact, with harshness,<br>
and with what is unconnected with the goal;<br>
He reproves with inner hatred,<br>
not with a mind of loving-kindness: <br>
this is the kind called one who reproves <br>
according to what is not the rule.”</p>
<p>“‘I too know the truth’—<br>
this is the kind called one who reproves <br>
according to what is not the rule.<br>
And I am asking you another: <br>
what is the kind called one who reproves <br>
according to the rule?”</p>
<p>“He reproves at a right time,<br>
about fact, with gentleness,<br>
with what is connected with the goal,<br>
He reproves with a mind of loving-kindness,<br>
not with inner hatred: <br>
this is the kind called one who reproves <br>
according to the rule.”</p>
<p>“‘I too know the truth’—<br>
this is the kind called one who reproves <br>
according to the rule.<br>
And I am asking you another: <br>
what is the kind called one who reproves Ignorantly?”</p>
<p>“He does not know the earlier and the later, <br>
he is unskilled in the earlier and the later,<br>
He does not know the sequence of the connecting words,<br>
he is unskilled in the sequence of the connecting words: <br>
this is the kind called one who reproves ignorantly.”</p>
<p>“‘I too know the truth’—<br>
this is the kind called one who reproves ignorantly.<br>
And I am asking you another: <br>
what is the kind called one who reproves wisely?”</p>
<p>“He knows the earlier and the later,
<br>
he is skilled in the earlier and the later,<br>
He knows the sequence of the connecting words,<br>
is skilled
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.258" href="#BD.6.258"></a>
in the sequence of the connecting words: <br>
this is kind called one who reproves wisely.”</p>
<p>“‘I too know the truth’—<br>
this is the kind called one who reproves wisely.<br>
And I am asking you another: <br>
what is reproving called?”</p>
<p>“He reproves for falling away from moral habit,<br>
then from right behaviour and view,<br>
And he reproves for a (wrong) mode of livelihood: <br>
therefore it is called reproving.”</p>
