<h2>First Division</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Prv.21"></a>
<a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Prv.21.1"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.1" href="#Prv.21.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.359" href="#BD.6.359"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.220" href="#Vin.5.220"></a>
Four formal acts: formal act for which leave should be asked, formal act at
which a motion is put, formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by
one resolution, formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by the
resolution made three times. In how many ways are these four formal acts
invalid?</p>
<p>In five ways are these four formal acts invalid: as to matter, or as to motion,
or as to proclamation, or as to boundary, or as to assembly.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.2" href="#Prv.21.1.2"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to matter? One carries out a formal act that
should be carried out in the presence of not in the presence of: a formal act
(carried out) not by rule is invalid as to matter. One carries out a formal act
that should be carried out by a question asked in return not by a question
asked in return: a formal act (carried out) not by rule is invalid as to
matter. One carries out a formal act that should be carried out on his
acknowledgement not on his acknowledgement … to one who merits a verdict of
innocence he gives a verdict of past insanity … for one who merits a verdict of
past insanity he carries out a formal act for a decision for specific depravity
… for one who merits a decision for specific depravity he carries out a formal
act of censure … for one who merits a formal act of censure he carries out a
formal act of guidance … for one who merits a formal act of guidance he carries
out a formal act of banishment … for one who <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.360" href="#BD.6.360"></a>
merits a formal act of banishment he carries out a formal act of reconciliation
… for one who merits a formal act of reconciliation he carries out a formal act
of suspension … to one who merits a formal act of suspension he gives probation
one who merits probation he sends back to the beginning to one who merits being
sent back to the beginning he gives <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> … one who merits <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> he rehabilitates … one who merits rehabilitation he ordains … he carries out
Observance not on an Observance day … he invites not on an Invitation day: a
formal act (carried out) not by rule is invalid as to matter. Thus are formal
acts invalid as to matter.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.3" href="#Prv.21.1.3"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to motion? In five ways are formal acts invalid
as to motion: one does not touch on the matter, he does not touch on the Order,
he does not touch on the individual, he does not touch on the motion, or, later
he sets aside the motion. Formal acts as to motion are invalid in these five
ways.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.4" href="#Prv.21.1.4"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to proclamation? In five
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.221" href="#Vin.5.221"></a>
ways are formal acts invalid as to proclamation: one does not touch on the
matter … on the Order … on the individual, he omits an announcement, or he
announces at a wrong time. Formal acts as to proclamation are invalid in these
five ways.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.5" href="#Prv.21.1.5"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to boundary? In eleven ways are formal acts
invalid as to boundary: one agrees on a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.361" href="#BD.6.361"></a>
boundary that is very small, he agrees on a boundary that is very extensive, he
agrees on a boundary whose mark is interrupted, he agrees on a boundary in the
shade, he agrees on “not a mark” as a boundary; standing outside a boundary he
agrees on a boundary; he agrees on a boundary that is in a river; he agrees on
a boundary that is in the sea; he agrees on a boundary that is in a natural
lake; he combines boundary with boundary; he places boundary within boundary.
Formal acts as to boundary are invalid in these eleven ways.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.6" href="#Prv.21.1.6"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to assembly? In twelve ways are formal acts
invalid as to assembly: when a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete
fourfold assembly, if as many monks as are entitled to take part in the formal
act are not come, if the leave of absence of those fit to declare their leave
of absence is not sent, if those who are present protest; when a formal act is
being carried out by an incomplete fourfold assembly, if as many monks as are
entitled to take part in the formal act are come, if the leave of absence of
those fit to declare their leave of absence is not sent, if those who are
present protest; when a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete
fourfold assembly, if as many monks as are entitled to take part in the formal
act are come, if the leave of absence <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.362" href="#BD.6.362"></a>
of those fit to declare their leave of absence is sent, if those who are
present protest; when a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete
fivefold assembly … tenfold assembly … twentyfold assembly, if as many monks as
are entitled to take part in the formal act are come, if the leave of absence
of those fit to declare their leave of absence is sent, if those who are
present protest. Formal acts as to assembly are invalid in these twelve ways.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.7" href="#Prv.21.1.7"></a>
When a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete fourfold assembly four
regular monks are entitled to take part in the formal act, the remainder who
are regular monks are fit to declare leave of absence. He for whom the Order is
carrying out the formal act is neither entitled to take part in the formal act
nor is he fit to declare leave of absence, but he merits the formal act.</p>
<p>When a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete fivefold assembly five
regular monks …</p>
<p>When a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete tenfold assembly ten
regular monks …</p>
<p>When a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete twentyfold assembly
twenty regular monks … but he merits the formal act.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.8" href="#Prv.21.1.8"></a>
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.222" href="#Vin.5.222"></a>
Four formal acts: formal act for which leave should be asked, formal act at
which a motion is put, formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by
one resolution, formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by the
resolution made three times. In how many ways are these four formal acts
invalid? In five ways are these four formal acts invalid: as to matter, or as
to motion, or as to proclamation, or as to boundary, or as to assembly.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.9" href="#Prv.21.1.9"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to matter? One ordains a eunuch: a formal act
(carried out) not by rule is invalid as <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.363" href="#BD.6.363"></a>
to matter. One ordains one who is in communion by theft … one who has gone over
to (another) sect … one ordains an animal … one ordains a matricide … a
parricide … a murderer of an arahant … a seducer of a nun … a schismatic … a
shedder of (a Tathāgata’s) blood … a hermaphrodite … one ordains a man who is
less than twenty years of age: a formal act (carried out) not by rule is
invalid as to matter.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.10" href="#Prv.21.1.10"></a>
How are formal acts invalid as to motion …
<span class="add">= <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-pvr21#Prv.21.1.3">Prv.21.1.3</a>–<a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-pvr21#Prv.21.1.6">Prv.21.1.6</a></span> … Formal acts as to assembly are invalid in these twelve ways.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.11" href="#Prv.21.1.11"></a>
How many possibilities does a formal act for which leave should be asked have
access to … a formal act at which a motion is put … a formal act at which a
motion is put and is followed by one resolution … How many possibilities does a
formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by the resolution made
three times have access to? A formal act for which leave should be asked has
access to five possibilities; a formal act at which a motion is put has access
to nine possibilities; a formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by
one resolution has access to seven possibilities; a formal act at which a
motion is put and is followed by a resolution made three times has access to
seven possibilities.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.12" href="#Prv.21.1.12"></a>
Which are the five possibilities to which a formal act for which leave should
be asked has access? Restoration, being sent away, close shaving, the higher
penalty, a characteristic mark of the formal act is itself the fifth. These are
the five possibilities to which a formal act for which leave should be asked
has access.</p>
<p>Which are the nine possibilities to which a formal, act at which a motion is
put has access? Restoration, being sent <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.364" href="#BD.6.364"></a>
away, Observance, Invitation, agreement, giving, way of accepting, rejection, a
characteristic mark of the formal act is itself the ninth. These are the nine
possibilities to which a formal act at which a motion is put has access.</p>
<p>Which are the seven possibilities to which a formal act at which a motion is
put and is followed by one resolution has access? Restoration, being sent away,
agreement, giving, removal, marking out, a characteristic mark of the formal
act is itself the seventh. These are the seven possibilities to which a formal
act at which a motion is put and is followed by one resolution has access.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.365" href="#BD.6.365"></a>
Which are the seven possibilities to which a formal act at which a motion is
put and is followed by the resolution made three times has access? Restoration,
being sent away, agreement, giving, rebuke, admonition, a characteristic mark
of the formal act is itself the seventh. These are the seven possibilities to
which a formal act at which a motion is put and is followed by the resolution
made three times has access.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.1.13" href="#Prv.21.1.13"></a>
When a formal act is being carried out by an incomplete fourfold assembly four
regular monks … <span class="add">= <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-pvr21#Prv.21.1.7">Prv.21.1.7</a></span> …

incomplete twentyfold assembly … but he merits the formal act.</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.2.1" href="#Prv.21.2.1"></a>
Founded on two reasons the rule of training was laid down for disciples by the
Tathāgata for the excellence of the Order, for the comfort of the Order:
founded on these two reasons the rule of training was laid down for disciples
by the Tathāgata. Founded on two reasons … for the restraint of evil-minded
men, for the dwelling in comfort of well behaved monks: founded on these two
reasons the rule of training was laid down for disciples by the Tathāgata.
Founded on two reasons … for the restraint of the cankers belonging to the here
and now, for combating the cankers belonging to future states … for the
restraint of dreadful actions belonging to the here and now, for the combating
of dreadful actions belonging to future states … for the restraint of blamable
actions belonging to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.366" href="#BD.6.366"></a>
the here and now, for the combating of blamable actions belonging to future
states … for the restraint of fears belonging to the here and now, for the
combating of fears belonging to future states … for the restraint of unskilled
things belonging to the here and now, for the combating of unskilled things
belonging to future states … out of compassion for householders, for breaking
up the factions of evil-minded (individuals) … for pleasing those who are not
yet pleased and for increasing the number of those who are pleased … for
establishing True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>, and for protecting Discipline. Founded on these two reasons the rule of
training was laid down for disciples by the Tathāgata.</p>
<p class="end">Concluded is the Second Division: on Reasons</p>
<h2>Third Division</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Prv.21.3"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.3.1" href="#Prv.21.3.1"></a>

laying down, a laying down that is a verdict in the presence of, … a verdict of
innocence … of past insanity, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.224" href="#Vin.5.224"></a>
a laying down that is to be carried out on his acknowledgement, a laying down
that is the decision of the majority, a laying down for specific depravity, a
covering over (as) with grass is laid down for the excellence of the Order, for

<h2>Fifth Division</h2>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Prv.21.5"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.5.1" href="#Prv.21.5.1"></a>
Nine classifications: classification by matter, classification by falling away,
classification by offence, classification by provenance, classification by
individual, classification by class, classification by origin, classification
by legal question, classification by deciding.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.5.2" href="#Prv.21.5.2"></a>
When a legal question has arisen, if two come who are hostile about the matter,
the matter should be announced to both; when the matter has been announced to
both the acknowledgement of both should be made known; when the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.368" href="#BD.6.368"></a>
acknowledgement of both has been heard both should say “After this legal
question of ours is settled both should be satisfied”. If they say, “Both will
be satisfied,” that legal question should be accepted by the Order. If the
assembly has a majority of shameless (persons), it should be settled by means
of a referendum. If the assembly has a majority of ignorant (persons), a
Vinaya-expert should be sought. He settles that legal question according to
rule, according to discipline, according to the Teacher’s instruction—so should
that legal question be settled.</p>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Prv.21.5.3" href="#Prv.21.5.3"></a>
The matter should be known, the kind should be known, the name should be known,
the offence should be known. Sexual intercourse means matter as well as kind;

been given means matter as well as kind; offence involving Defeat means name as
well as offence. Human being … State of further-men means matter as well as

means matter as well as kind; offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order
means name as well as offence. Physical contact means matter as well as kind;
offence requiring a Formal Meeting of the Order means name as well as offence.
Lewd words … Sense-pleasures for self … Go-between … Begging for oneself for
having a hut built … for having a large <i lang="pi">vihāra</i> built … Defaming a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence involving
Defeat … Defaming a monk with a charge of an offence involving Defeat taking up
some point as a pretext in a legal question really belonging to something else
… <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi5.225" href="#Vin.5.225"></a>
The not giving up (of his course) by a schismatic monk though there is
admonition up to the third time … The not giving up (of their course) by monks
who are imitators of schismatics though there is admonition up to the third
time … The not giving up (of his course) by a monk who is difficult to speak to
though there is admonition up to the third time … The not giving up (of his
course) by a monk who brings families into disrepute though there is admonition
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.6.369" href="#BD.6.369"></a>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>So, having asked this and that <br>
about the way of former teachers<br>
Dīpanāma of great wisdom, <br>
who remembered what he had heard, attentive,</p>
<p>Thinking out this epitome of the details <br>
for the middle way of study,<br>
Had it written <br>
for bringing happiness to disciples.</p>
<p>“Parivāra” means all that is said <br>
as to matter with the characteristic mark,<br>
Meaning by meaning in the True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>, <br>
rule by rule in what is laid down,<br>
It encompasses the Dispensation <br>
as the ocean (encompasses) India.</p>

Not knowing the Parivāra <br>
whence is there discrimination between the rules?</p>
<p>Falling away, matter, laying down, <br>
supplementary laying down, individual,<br>
For one (Order), for both, <br>
as well as what is held blameworthy by the world—</p>
<p>Doubt, for whomever it arises, <br>
is cut off by the Parivāra.<br>
As a universal monarch amid his vast forces, <br>
as a maned lion in the midst of deer,</p>
<p>Like the sun surrounded by its rays, <br>
like the moon in a host of stars,<br>
As Brahmā in a company of Brahmās, <br>
as a leader in the midst of his following—<br>
Thus through the Parivāra <br>
the True <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>-and-Discipline shines forth.</p>
