… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Caṇḍakālī was one who made strife, who made quarrels, who made
contention, who made brawls, who made disputes in the Order. The nun
Thullanandā protested when a (formal) act was being carried out against her. At
that time the nun Thullanandā went to a village on some business. Then the
Order of nuns, thinking: “The nun Thullanandā has gone away,” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.231" href="#Vin.4.231"></a>
suspended the nun Caṇḍakālī for not seeing an offence. The nun Thullanandā
having concluded that business in the village, returned again to Sāvatthī. When
the nun Thullanandā was coming, the nun Caṇḍakālī neither made ready a seat,
nor put out water for washing her feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand, nor having
gone out to meet her did she take her bowl and robe, nor did she offer her
drinking-water. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to the nun Caṇḍakālī:</p>
<p>“Why did you, lady, when I was coming, neither make ready a seat for me nor put
out water for washing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.192" href="#BD.3.192"></a>
the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand, nor having gone out to meet me, take my
howl and robe, nor offer me drinking-water?”</p>
<p>“Surely it is this, lady, that I am without a mistress in regard to this.”</p>
<p>“But why are you, lady, without a mistress?”</p>
<p>“Lady, these nuns, saying of me, ‘She is without a mistress, she is not
esteemed, there is no one who can answer for her,’ suspended me for not seeing
an offence.”</p>
<p>The nun Thullanandā, saying, “These are ignorant, these are inexperienced, they
do not (even) know a (formal) act or the defect of a (formal) act or the
failure of a (formal) act or the success of a (formal) act; but we know a
(formal) act and the defect of a (formal) act and the failure of a (formal) act
and the success of a (formal) act, and we may make them carry out a (formal)
act that was not carried out or we may find fault with a (formal) act that was
carried out,” and having very quickly convened an Order of nuns, she restored
the nun Caṇḍakalī. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, without having obtained permission from the
Order which carried out the proceedings in accordance with the rule, the
discipline, the teacher’s instruction, not having learnt the desire of a group,
restore a nun suspended by a complete Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, without having
obtained permission … restored a nun suspended by a complete Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.193" href="#BD.3.193"></a>
The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, without having obtained permission …
restore a nun suspended by a complete Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this
rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, without having obtained permission from the Order which carried
out the proceedings in accordance with the rule, the discipline, the teacher’s
instruction, not having learnt the group’s desire, should restore a nun
suspended by a complete Order, that nun also has fallen into a matter that is
an offence at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being
sent away.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Ss.4.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.4.2.1" href="#Bi-Ss.4.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Complete Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">belonging to the same communion, staying within the same boundary. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.232" href="#Vin.4.232"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Suspended</span> means:
<span class="gloss">suspended for not seeing or for not making amends for or for not giving up an
offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">In accordance with the rule, the discipline</span> means:
<span class="gloss">according to whatever is the rule, according to whatever is the discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">(In accordance with) the teacher’s instruction</span> means:
<span class="gloss">in accordance with the conqueror’s instruction, the enlightened one’s
instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Without having obtained permission from the Order which carried out the
proceedings</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not having asked (the permission) of the Order which carried out the (formal)
act.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not having learnt</span> the desire means:
<span class="gloss">not having known the desire of a group.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will restore (her),” (and) looks about for a group or
determines a boundary, there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of the
motion, there is an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of two proclamations, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.194" href="#BD.3.194"></a>
there are grave offences. At the end of the proclamations, there is an offence
entailing a formal meeting of the Order.</p>
<p><span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence at once</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.4.2.2" href="#Bi-Ss.4.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act
(and) restores her, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order. If she is in doubt as to whether it is a legally valid act … If she
thinks that it is not a legally valid act when it is a legally valid act (and)
restores her, there is an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. If
she thinks that it is a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is not
a legally valid act, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it
is not a legally valid act when it is not a legally valid act, there is an
offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.4.2.3" href="#Bi-Ss.4.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, having obtained permission from, the Order which
carried out the (formal) act, she restores (her); if she restores (her) having
known that it is the desire of the group; if she restores one who is behaving
so as to get rid of the fault; if she restores (her), there being no Order
which carried out the (formal) act; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
