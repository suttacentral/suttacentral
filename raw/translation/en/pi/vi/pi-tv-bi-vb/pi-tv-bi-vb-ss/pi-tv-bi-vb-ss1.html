These seventeen things, venerable ones, entailing formal meetings of the Order,
come for exposition.</p>
<p>At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain lay-follower,
having given a store-room to an Order of nuns, passed away. He had two sons,
one of no faith, not believing, the other with faith, believing. Then he of no
faith, not believing, spoke thus to him with faith, believing: “The store-room
is ours, let us deal it out.” When he had spoken thus, the one with faith,
believing, spoke thus to him of no faith, not believing: “Do not, sir, speak
thus; it was given to the Order of nuns by our father.” And a second time he of
no faith, not believing, spoke thus to him with faith, believing: “The
storeroom is ours, let us deal it out.” Then the one with faith, believing,
spoke thus to him of no faith, not believing: “Do not, sir, speak thus; it was
given to the Order of nuns by our father.” And a third time he of no faith … “…
let us deal it out.” Then the one with faith, believing, thinking,” If it
became mine, I also would give it to an Order of nuns,” spoke thus to the one
of no faith, not believing: “Let us deal it out.” Then that store-room being
dealt out by these, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.178" href="#BD.3.178"></a>
fell to him of no faith, not believing. Then the one of no faith, not
believing, having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “You must depart, ladies,
the store-room is ours.” When he had spoken thus, the nun Thullanandā spoke
thus to that man:</p>
<p>“Do not, sir, speak thus; the store-room was given to the Order of nuns by your
father.”</p>
<p>Saying: “Was it given (or) not given?” they asked the chief ministers of
justice. The chief ministers spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Who knows, ladies, if it was given to the Order of nuns?” When they had spoken
thus, the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to these chief ministers: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.224" href="#Vin.4.224"></a>
</p>
<p>“But, masters, was not the gift seen or heard of by you as it was being given,
eye-witnesses having been arranged?” Then the chief ministers, saying: “What
the lady says is true,” made over the store-room to the Order of nuns. Then
that man, defeated, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“These shaven-headed (women) are not (true) recluses, they are strumpets. How
can they have the store-room taken away from us?” The nun Thullanandā told this
matter to the chief ministers. The chief ministers had that man punished. Then
that man, punished, having had a sleeping-place made for Naked Ascetics not far
from the nunnery, instigated the Naked Ascetics, saying: “Talk down these
nuns.” The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the chief ministers. The chief
ministers had that man fettered. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it
about, saying: “How can these nuns have a store-room taken away (from him) and
secondly have him punished and <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.179" href="#BD.3.179"></a>
thirdly have him fettered? Now they will have him killed.”</p>
<p>Nuns heard these people as they … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā be one who speaks in
envy?” Then these nuns told this matter to the monks …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā is one who speaks in
envy?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā be one who speaks in envy? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the
nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should be one who speaks in envy concerning a householder or a
householder’s sons (or brothers) or a slave or a workman and even concerning a
wanderer who is a recluse, that nun has fallen into a matter that is an offence
at once, entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.1.2.1" href="#Bi-Ss.1.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">One who speaks in envy</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is called a bringer of law-suits.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Householder</span> means:
<span class="gloss">he who lives in a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Householder’s sons (or brothers)</span> means:
<span class="gloss">whoever are sons and brothers.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.180" href="#BD.3.180"></a>
<span class="term">Slave</span> means:
<span class="gloss">born within, bought for money, taken in a raid.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Workman</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a hireling, a worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Wanderer who is a recluse</span> means:
<span class="gloss">setting aside monk and nun and probationer and novice and female novice, he who
is endowed with (the status of) wanderer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.225" href="#Vin.4.225"></a>
</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will bring a law-suit,” or looks about for a companion or
goes herself, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she announces it to one
(person), there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she announces it to a second,
there is a grave offence. At the end of the law-suit, there is an offence
entailing a formal meeting of the Order.</p>
<p><span class="term">An offence at once</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she falls through transgression of a course, not after admonition.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Involving being sent away</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is caused to be sent away from the Order.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the Order inflicts the
<i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline on account of her offence, it sends back to the beginning, it
rehabilitates; it is not several (nuns), it is not one nun, therefore it is
called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. A synonym for this
class of offence is (formal) <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.181" href="#BD.3.181"></a>
act, therefore again it is called an offence entailing a formal meeting of the
Order.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Ss.1.2.2" href="#Bi-Ss.1.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if she goes being dragged along by people; if she asks for
protection; if she explains without reference (to a particular person); if she
is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
