Recited, ladies, are the eight rules for offences which ought to be confessed.
Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this
matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter?
And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The
ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I
understand this.</p>
<p class="end">Told are the offences which ought to be confessed. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.349" href="#Vin.4.349"></a>
