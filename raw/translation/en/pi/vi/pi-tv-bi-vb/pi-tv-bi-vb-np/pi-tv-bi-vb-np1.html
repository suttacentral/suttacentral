These thirty rules, ladies, for offences of expiation involving forfeiture come
up for recitation.</p>
<p>At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns made
a hoard of many bowls. People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place and seeing
(this hoard), looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can
these nuns make a hoard of many bowls? Will these nuns do a trade in bowls or
will they set up an earthenware shop?”</p>
<p>Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns make a hoard of
bowls?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns made a hoard of
bowls?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the group
of six nuns make a hoard of bowls? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are
not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should make a hoard of bowls, there is an offence of expiation
involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-NP.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.1.2.1" href="#Bi-NP.1.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Bowl</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are two (kinds of) bowls: an iron bowl, a clay bowl. There are three
sizes for a bowl: a <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.214" href="#BD.3.214"></a>
large bowl, a medium-sized bowl, a small bowl. A large bowl means that it takes
half an <i lang="pi">āḷhaka</i> measure of boiled rice, or a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice or a
suitable curry. A medium-sized bowl means that it, takes a <i lang="pi">nāḷika</i> measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a
suitable curry. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.244" href="#Vin.4.244"></a>
A small bowl means that it takes a <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure of boiled rice, a quarter of that quantity of uncooked rice, a
suitable curry. (A bowl) greater than that is not a bowl, (a bowl) smaller
(than that) is not a bowl.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should make a hoard</span> means:
<span class="gloss">what is not allotted, not assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">It is to be forfeited</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it should be forfeited at sunrise. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a
group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: That nun, having
approached an Order, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, having
honoured the feet of the senior nuns, having sat down on her haunches, having
saluted with joined palms, should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, this bowl is to be forfeited by me, a night having elapsed. I forfeit
it to the Order.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent nun; the bowl forfeited should be
given back (with the words): <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This bowl of the nun so and so which had
to be forfeited is forfeited (by her) to the Order. If it seems right to the
Order, let the Order give back this bowl to the nun so and so.’</span></span></p>
<p>That nun, having approached several nuns, having arranged her upper robe over
one shoulder … having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, this bowl is to be forfeited by me, a night having elapsed. <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.215" href="#BD.3.215"></a>
I forfeit it to the ladies.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by an experienced, competent nun; the bowl forfeited should be
given back (with the words): <span class="kamma">‘Let the ladies listen to me. This bowl of the nun so and so which had to be
forfeited is forfeited (by her) to the ladies. If it seems right to the ladies,
let the ladies give back this bowl to the nun so and so.’</span></p>
<p>That nun, having approached one nun, having arranged her upper robe over one
shoulder, having sat down on her haunches, having saluted with joined palms,
should speak thus: <span class="kamma">‘Lady, this bowl is to be forfeited by me, a night having elapsed. I forfeit it
to the lady.’</span> Having forfeited it, the offence should be confessed. The offence should be
acknowledged by this nun; the bowl forfeited should be given back (with the
words): <span class="kamma">‘I will give back this bowl to the lady.’</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.1.2.2" href="#Bi-NP.1.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that a night has elapsed when it has elapsed, there is an offence
of expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt as to whether a night has
elapsed … If she thinks that a night has not elapsed when it has elapsed, there
is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she thinks that it is
allotted when it is not allotted … If she thinks that it is assigned when it is
not assigned <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.245" href="#Vin.4.245"></a>
… If she thinks that it is bestowed when it is not bestowed … If she thinks
that it is lost when it is not lost … If she thinks that it is destroyed when
it is not destroyed … If she thinks that it is broken when it is not broken …
If she thinks that it is stolen when it is not stolen, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If, not having forfeited the bowl which had to
be forfeited, she makes use of it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that a night has elapsed when it has not elapsed, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether a night has not elapsed, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that a night has not elapsed when it
has not elapsed, there is no offence.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.216" href="#BD.3.216"></a>
There is no offence if before sunrise it is allotted, assigned, bestowed, lost,
destroyed, broken, if they tear it from her, if they take it on trust; if she
is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>

Then the group of six nuns did not give back a bowl that was forfeited. They
told this matter … to the lord. He said: “Monks, a bowl that is forfeited is
not to be given back. Whosoever should not give it back, there is an offence of
wrong-doing.”</p>
