… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
lay-followers, having made a voluntary collection for robe-material for an
Order of nuns, having laid aside what was necessary in a certain cloak-seller’s
house, having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a
cloak-seller’s house what is necessary for robe-material is laid aside. Having
had that robe-material brought from there, distribute it.”</p>
<p>The nuns, having got medicine in exchange for what was necessary, made use of
it. The lay-followers, having found out … spread it about, saying: “How can
these nuns get something in exchange for what was necessary (and) appointed for
another thing, destined <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.229" href="#BD.3.229"></a>
for another thing, belonging to an Order?” Nuns heard these lay-followers who …
spread it about. Those who were modest nuns <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.251" href="#Vin.4.251"></a>
… spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these nuns get something in exchange … belonging to an Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns got something in exchange … belonging
to an Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns get something in exchange … belonging to an Order? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should get something in exchange for that which was necessary
(and) appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, (and) belonging
to an Order, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">For what was necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for another
thing</span> means:
<span class="gloss">for what was given for another thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Belonging to an Order</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is for an Order, not for a group, not for one nun.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should get something in exchange</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having set aside that for which it was given, if she gets another thing in
exchange, there is an offence of wrong-doing in the action; it is to be
forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or
to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class="kamma">‘Ladies, this thing got in exchange for that which was necessary (and)
appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, (and) belonging to an
Order, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.230" href="#BD.3.230"></a>
is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.’</span> …
<span class="kamma">“… the Order should give back, … let the ladies give back … I will give back
(this thing) to the lady.”</span></span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.6.2.2" href="#Bi-NP.6.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it was appointed for another thing when it was appointed for
another thing, and gets something else in exchange, there is an offence of
expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt … If she thinks that it was
not appointed for another thing … there is an offence of expiation involving
forfeiture. Having acquired what was forfeited, it may be taken as, so to
speak, a gift. If she thinks that it was appointed for another thing when it
was not appointed for another thing, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she
is in doubt as to whether it was not appointed for another thing, there is an
offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it was not appointed for another
thing when it was not appointed for another thing, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.6.2.3" href="#Bi-NP.6.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she takes a remainder; if she takes having obtained the
owner’s permission; if there are’ accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first
wrong-doer.</p>
