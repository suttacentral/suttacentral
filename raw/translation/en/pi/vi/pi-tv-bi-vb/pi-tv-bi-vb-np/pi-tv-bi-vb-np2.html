… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
several nuns, having spent the rains in a village-residence, went to Sāvatthī
keeping the customs, dignified in deportment, badly dressed, wearing shabby
robes. Lay-followers having seen these nuns, thinking, “These nuns are keeping
the customs … wearing shabby robes, these nuns will have been robbed,” gave
robe-material to the Order of nuns not at the right time. The nun Thullanandā,
saying, “Our <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth is (formally) made, it was robe-material given at the right time,”
having allotted it, had it distributed. The lay-followers having seen those
nuns, spoke thus: “Was not the robe-material received by the ladies?”</p>
<p>“We did not receive robe-material, sirs. The lady Thullanandā, saying, ‘Our <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth is (formally) made; it was robe-material given at the right time,’
having allotted it, had it distributed.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.218" href="#BD.3.218"></a>
The lay-followers … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, thinking that robe-material (given) not at the
right time was robe-material (given) at the right time, having allotted it,
have it distributed?”</p>
<p>Nuns heard these lay-followers who … spread it about. Those who were modest
nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā thinking … have
it distributed?”</p>
<p>Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks … to the lord. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.246" href="#Vin.4.246"></a>
He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … had it distributed?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … have it distributed? It is not, monks,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, thinking that robe-material (given) not at the right time is
robe-material (given) at the right time, having allotted it should have it
distributed, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-NP.2.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.2.2.1" href="#Bi-NP.2.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Robe-material (given) not at the right time</span> means:
<span class="gloss">some that has accrued during the eleven months when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth is not (formally) made; some that has accrued during the seven months
when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth is (formally) made; a gift (of material) offered even at the right time;
this means robe-material (given) not at the right time.</span></p>
<p>If thinking, “It is robe-material (given) at the right
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.219" href="#BD.3.219"></a>
time,” having allotted it, she has it distributed, in the action there is an
offence of wrong-doing; on acquisition it is to be forfeited. It should be
forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it
be forfeited: <span class="kamma">“Ladies, I, thinking that this robe-material (given) not at the right time was
robe-material (given) at the right time, having allotted it, caused it to be
distributed; it is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.”</span> …
<span class="kamma">“… let the Order give back … they should give back … I will give back (this
robe-material) to the lady.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.2.2.2" href="#Bi-NP.2.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is robe-material (given) not at the right time when it is
robe-material (given) not at the right, time, and saying, “It is robe-material
(given) at the right time,” having allotted it she has it distributed, there is
an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt as to whether
it is robe-material (given) not at the right time … there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is robe-material (given) at the right time
when it is robe-material (given) not at the right time … there is no offence.
If she thinks that it is robe-material (given) not at the right time when it is
robe-material (given) at the right time, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
she is in doubt as to whether it is robe-material (given) at the right time,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is robe-material
(given) at the right time when it is robe-material (given) at the right time,
there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-NP.2.2.3" href="#Bi-NP.2.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she thinks that it is robe-material (given) not at the
right time when it is robe-material (given) not at the right time and has it
distributed; if she thinks that it is robe-material (given) at the right time
when it is robe-material (given) at the right time and has it distributed; if
she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
