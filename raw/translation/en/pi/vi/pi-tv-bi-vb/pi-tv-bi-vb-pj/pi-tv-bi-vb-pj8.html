… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six nuns, filled with desire, for the sake of following what was
verily not the rule, consented to taking hold of the hand of a male person who
was filled with desire, and they consented to taking hold of the edge of (his)
outer robe, and they stood and they talked and they went to a rendezvous and
they consented to a man’s approaching (them) and they entered into a covered
place and they disposed the body for such a purpose. Those who were modest nuns
… spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six nuns, filled with desire, for the sake of following
what is verily not the rule, consent to … and stand and talk and go to a
rendezvous … and enter … and dispose …?” “It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the group
of six nuns … consent to … dispose the body for such a purpose? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the
nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, filled with desire, for the sake of following what is verily not
the rule, should consent to taking hold of the hand of a male person who is
filled with desire or should consent to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer
cloak or should stand or should talk or should go to a rendezvous <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.221" href="#Vin.4.221"></a>
or should consent to a man’s approaching (her) or should enter into a covered
place or should dispose the body for such a purpose, she <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.174" href="#BD.3.174"></a>
also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is a doer of
eight things.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Filled with desire</span> means:
<span class="gloss">infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Filled with desire</span> means:
<span class="gloss">infatuated, full of desire, physically in love with.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">A male person</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a human man, not a <i lang="pi">yakkha</i>, not a departed one, not an animal; he is learned, competent to come into
physical contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should consent to taking hold of the hand</span> means:
<span class="gloss">hand means, going up from the tip of the nail as far as the elbow. If for the
sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to taking hold
below the collarbone, above the circles of the knees, there is a grave
offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should consent to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer cloak</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to take
hold of what he is clothed in or of what he has put on, there is a grave
offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should stand</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she stands within the
reach of a man’s hand, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should talk</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she talks standing
within the reach of a man’s hand, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should go to a rendezvous</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she, being told by a
man, ‘Come to such and such a place,’ goes (there), for every step there is an
offence of wrong-doing. In merely approaching the reach of a man’s hand, there
is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should consent to a man’s approaching</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.175" href="#BD.3.175"></a>
for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to a man’s
approaching, there is an offence of wrong-doing. In merely approaching a reach
of his hand, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should enter into a covered place</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, in merely entering
any concealed place whatever, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Or should dispose the body for such a purpose</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, standing within the
reach of a man’s hand, she disposes the body, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She becomes one who is defeated</span> means:
<span class="gloss">as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown cannot become one for new growth, so a
nun, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.222" href="#Vin.4.222"></a>
completing the eight courses, becomes one who is not a (true) recluse, not a
daughter of the Sakyans;</span> therefore she is called she becomes one who is defeated.</p>
<p><span class="term">Not in communion</span> means:
<span class="gloss">communion …</span> is therefore called
<span class="term">not in communion</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pj.8.2.2" href="#Bi-Pj.8.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if it is not intentional; if she is not thinking; if she
does not know; if she does not consent: if she is mad, her mind unhinged,
afflicted with pain, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
<p class="end">Told is the Fourth Offence involving Defeat</p>
<hr>
<p>Recited, ladies, are the eight offences involving defeat; a nun having fallen
into one or other of these does not receive communion together with the nuns; <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.176" href="#BD.3.176"></a>
as before, so after, she becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion.
Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this
matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter?
And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The
ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I
understand this.</p>
<p class="end">Told is the Portion on Defeat <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.223" href="#Vin.4.223"></a>
