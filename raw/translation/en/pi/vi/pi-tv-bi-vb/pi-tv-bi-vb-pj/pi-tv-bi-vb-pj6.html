… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Sundarīnandā became pregnant by Saḷhā, Migāra’s grandson. Until the
embryo quickened she concealed it; when the embryo was matured, having left the
Order, she gave birth. Nuns spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “Lady,
Sundarīnandā not long after leaving the Order gave birth. We wonder if she was
pregnant when she was a nun?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ladies.”</p>
<p>“But how is it that you, lady, knowing that a nun had fallen into a matter
involving defeat, neither reproved her yourself, nor spoke to a group?”</p>
<p>“Whatever is blame for her, that is blame for me; whatever is disgrace for her,
that is disgrace for me; whatever is dishonour for her, that is dishonour for
me; whatever is loss for her, that is loss for me. How can I, ladies, speak to
others of my own blame, my own disgrace, my own dishonour, my own loss?”</p>
<p>Those who were modest nuns looked down upon, criticised, spread it about,
saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, knowing that a nun had fallen into a
matter involving defeat, neither reprove her herself, nor speak to a group?”
Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to
the lord. Then the lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the
Order of monks convened, having given reasoned talk, questioned the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun …
neither reproved her herself, nor spoke to a group?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.166" href="#BD.3.166"></a>
“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun … neither reprove her
herself, nor speak to a group? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, knowing that a nun has fallen into a matter involving defeat,
should neither herself reprove her, nor speak to a group, but when she may be
remaining or deceased or expelled or withdrawn, should afterwards speak thus:
‘Ladies, before I knew this nun, she was a sister like this and like that,’ <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.217" href="#Vin.4.217"></a>
and should neither herself reprove her nor should speak to a group, she also
becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is one who conceals a
fault.</span>”</p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pj.6.2.1" href="#Bi-Pj.6.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she who …</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She knows</span> means:
<span class="gloss">either she knows by herself or others tell her or she tells (her).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Has fallen into a matter involving defeat</span> means:
<span class="gloss">of the eight offences involving defeat (she) has fallen into a certain offence
involving defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should neither herself reprove her</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should neither herself reprimand her.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nor should speak to a group</span> means:
<span class="gloss">nor should speak to other nuns.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.167" href="#BD.3.167"></a>
<span class="term">But when she may be remaining or deceased</span> means:
<span class="gloss">
<span class="term">Remaining</span> means
<span class="gloss">she is called remaining in her own characteristic.</span>
<span class="term">Deceased</span> means
<span class="gloss">she is called one who has passed away.</span>
<span class="term">Expelled</span> means
<span class="gloss">she herself comes to be leaving the Order or she is expelled by others.</span>
<span class="term">Withdrawn</span> means she is called one who has gone over to the fold of a sect.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should afterwards speak thus: ‘Ladies, before I knew this nun, she was a sister
like this and like that,’ and should neither herself reprove her</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should neither herself reprimand her; <i lang="pi">nor speak to a group</i> means: nor should speak to other nuns.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She also</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Becomes one who is defeated</span> means:
<span class="gloss">as a withered leaf freed from the stalk cannot become green again, so a nun,
knowing that a nun has fallen into a matter involving defeat (and) thinking, ‘I
will neither myself reprove her, nor speak to a group,’ in throwing off the
responsibility, becomes one who is not a recluse, not a daughter of the
Sakyans; therefore she is called, <span class="term">she becomes one who is defeated</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Is not in communion</span> means:
<span class="gloss">communion … is therefore called <span class="term">not in communion</span>.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pj.6.2.2" href="#Bi-Pj.6.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if she does not speak, thinking ‘There will come to be
quarrel or dispute or strife or contention for the Order’; if she does not
speak, thinking ‘There will come to be a schism in the Order or dissension in
the Order’; if she does not speak, thinking <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.168" href="#BD.3.168"></a>
‘This one, harsh, rough, will bring danger to life or danger to the Brahma-life
if she does not speak not seeing other suitable nuns; if she does not speak
(though) not desiring to conceal; if she does not speak, thinking: ‘It will be
evident from her own action’; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
