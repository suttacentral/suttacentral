<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.211" href="#Vin.4.211"></a>
At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta
Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, became
desirous of building a dwelling-house for the Order of nuns. Then Sāḷha,
Migāra’s grandson, having approached the nuns, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Ladies, I want to build a dwelling-place for the Order of nuns; give me a nun
who is an overseer of repairs.”</p>
<p>At that time four sisters had gone forth among the nuns: Nandā, Nandavatī,
Sundarīnandā, Thullanandā. Among these, the nun Sundarīnandā had gone forth
when she was young; she was beautiful, good to look upon, charming, she was
clever, experienced, wise, she was skilled, energetic, she was possessed of
consideration for those kinds of things, she was able to build, able to make
arrangements. Then the nuns, having chosen the nun Sundarīnandā, gave (her) as
overseer of repairs to Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.157" href="#BD.3.157"></a>
Now at that time the nun Sundarīnandā constantly went to the dwelling of Sāḷha,
Migāra’s grandson, saying: “Give a knife, give a hatchet, give an axe, give a
spade, give a chisel.” And Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, constantly went to the
nunnery to learn what was built and what was not built. These, through
constantly seeing (one another), came to be in love. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s
grandson, through not getting an opportunity to seduce the nun Sundarīnandā,
for this purpose gave a meal for the Order of nuns. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s
grandson, having appointed a seat in the refectory, thinking: “Some nuns are
senior to the lady Sundarīnandā,” appointed a seat to one side, and thinking:
“Some are junior,” appointed a seat to the other side. He appointed a seat for
the nun Sundarīnandā in a concealed place, in a corner, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.212" href="#Vin.4.212"></a>
so that the nuns who were elders might conclude, “She is sitting with the
junior nuns,” and the junior nuns might conclude, “She is sitting with the nuns
who are elders.”</p>
<p>Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, had the time announced to the Order of nuns,
saying: “It is time, ladies, the meal is ready.” The nun Sundarīnandā, having
realised (what was happening), thinking: “Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, is not
benevolent (although) he gave a meal for the Order of nuns; he wants to seduce
me. If I go, there will be trouble for me,” ordered her pupil, saying: “Go,
bring back almsfood for me, and if anyone asks for me, let it be known that I
am ill.”</p>
<p>“Very well, lady,” the nun answered the nun Sundariīnandā.</p>
<p>At that time Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, came to be standing outside the porch of
the door, asking for the nun Sundarīnandā, saying: “Where, lady, is the lady
Sundarīnandā; where, lady, is the lady Sundarīnandā?”</p>
<p>When he had spoken thus, the pupil of the nun Sundarīnandā spoke thus to Sāḷha,
Migāra’s grandson: <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.158" href="#BD.3.158"></a>
“She is ill, sir; I will take back her almsfood.” Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s
grandson, thinking: “This meal which I gave for the sake of the nuns was on
purpose for the lady Sundarīnandā,” and having commanded the people, having
said: “Offer the meal for the Order of nuns,” he approached the nunnery.</p>
<p>At that time the nun Sundarīnandā came to be standing outside the porch of the
monastery waiting for Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson. Then the nun Sundarīnandā saw
Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, coming from afar; seeing him, having entered the
dwelling, having put on her upper robe including over her head, she lay down on
a couch. Then Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, approached the nun Sundarīnandā; having
approached, lie spoke thus to the nun Sundarīnandā: “What is your discomfort,
lady? Why are you lying down?”</p>
<p>“Surely it is this, sir: she who desires is not desired.”</p>
<p>“How can I, lady, not desire you? But I did not get an opportunity to seduce
you,” and filled with desire he came into physical contact with the nun
Sundarīnandā, also filled with desire.</p>
<p>Now at that time a nun, weakened by age, her feet affected, came to be sitting
down not far from the nun Sundarīnandā. That nun saw Sāḷha, Migara’s grandson,
filled with desire, coming into physical contact with the nun Sundarīnandā,
(also) filled with desire; seeing them, she looked down upon, criticised,
spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Sundarīnandā, filled with desire,
consent to physical contact with a male person who is filled with desire?” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.213" href="#Vin.4.213"></a>
Then this nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns,
contented, conscientious, scrupulous, desirous of training, these looked down
upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Sundarīnandā,
filled with desire … with a male person who is filled with desire?” Then these
nuns told this matter to the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.159" href="#BD.3.159"></a>
monks. These monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How
can the nun Sundarīnandā, filled with desire … with a male person who is filled
with desire?” Then these monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on
this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened,
questioned the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā, filled with desire …
with a male person filled with desire?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord,” they said.</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not fitting, monks, in the nun Sundarīnandā, it is not suitable, it is
not becoming, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be
done. How, monks, can the nun Sundarīnandā, filled with desire, consent to
physical contact with a male person who is filled with desire? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the
number of) those who are pleased, but, monks, it is both for displeasing those
who are not (yet) pleased and those who are pleased, and for causing wavering
in some.”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having in many a figure rebuked the nun Sundarīnandā for her
difficulty in supporting herself, for her difficulty in maintaining herself,
having spoken in dispraise of great desires, of discontent, of clinging (to the
obstructions), of sloth; having in many a figure spoken in praise of ease in
supporting oneself, of ease in maintaining oneself, of desiring little, of
contentment, of expunging (evil), of punctiliousness, of graciousness, of
decreasing (the obstructions), of putting forth energy; having given reasoned
talk to the monks on what is fitting, on what is suitable, he addressed the
monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.160" href="#BD.3.160"></a>
“On account of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training for nuns founded
on ten reasons: for the excellence of the Order, for the comfort of the Order,
for the restraint of evil-minded nuns, for the ease of well-behaved nuns, for
the restraint of cankers belonging to the here and now, for the combating of
cankers belonging to other worlds, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased, for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased, for establishing
what is verily <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, for following the rules of restraint. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth
this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, filled with desire, should consent to rubbing, or rubbing up
against, or taking hold of or touching or pressing against a male person below
the collar-bone, above the circle of the knees, if he is filled with desire,
she also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is one who
touches above the circle of the knees.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.214" href="#Vin.4.214"></a>

activity, is called whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nun</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is a nun because she is a beggar for alms, she is a nun because she submits
to walking for alms, she is a nun because she is one who wears the patch-work
robes, she is a nun by the designation (of others), a nun because of her
acknowledgement, a nun (to whom it was) said, ‘Come, nun,’ a nun is one
ordained by the three goings to a refuge, a nun is auspicious, a nun is the
essential, a nun is a learner, a nun is an adept, a nun is ordained by both
complete Orders by means of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.161" href="#BD.3.161"></a>
a (formal) act at which the motion is put and followed by three proclamations,
irreversible and fit to stand. In this way is this nun one who is ordained by
both complete Orders by means of a (formal) act at which the motion was put and
followed by three proclamations, irreversible, fit to stand, and this is how
nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Filled with desire</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Becomes one who is defeated</span> means:
<span class="gloss">as a man with his head cut off cannot become one to live by attaching it to his
body, so a nun, filled with desire, consenting to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.162" href="#BD.3.162"></a>
rubbing or to rubbing up against or to taking hold of or to touching or to
pressing a man who is filled with desire below the collar-bone, above the
circle of the knees, becomes one who is not a recluse, not a daughter of the
Sakyans</span>; therefore she is called,
<span class="term">she becomes one who is defeated</span>.</p>
<p><span class="term">Is not in communion</span> means:
<span class="gloss">communion is called one (formal) act, one recital, an equal training; this is

<span class="term">not in communion</span>.</p>
