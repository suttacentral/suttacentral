… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain brahmin who earned (his keep) as a hireling of a king, saying, “I
will ask for wages as before,” having washed his head, went along beside a
nunnery to the royal court. A certain nun, having relieved herself in a
receptacle, in throwing it away over a wall, let it fall on that brahmin’s
head. Then that brahmin … spread it about, saying: “These shaven-headed
strumpets are not true recluses. How can they let a pot fall on my head? I will
set fire to their dwelling,” and having taken up a fire-brand, he entered the
dwelling. A certain lay follower as he was going out from the dwelling saw that
brahmin who, having taken up the fire-brand, was entering the dwelling. Seeing
him, he spoke thus to that brahmin: “Why do you, good sir, having taken up a
fire-brand, enter the dwelling?”</p>
<p>“Good sir, these shaven-headed strumpets let a pot fall on my head. I will set
fire to their dwelling.”</p>
<p>“Go away, good brahmin, this is auspicious; you will receive a thousand, and
this is (your) wage.” Then that brahmin, having washed his head, having gone to
the royal court, received a thousand, and this was the wage. Then that lay
follower, having entered the dwelling, having told this matter to the nuns,
scolded them. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can
these nuns throw out excrement over a wall?” …</p>
<p>Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns threw out excrement over a wall?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.258" href="#BD.3.258"></a>
The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … over a wall? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who
are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should throw out or should cause (another) to throw out excrement
or urine or rubbish or remains of food over a wall or over a fence, there is an
offence of expiation.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.266" href="#Vin.4.266"></a>

into what is not a track; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
