… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns made use of a sofa and of a divan. People, engaged in touring the dwelling
place, having seen (them) … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make
use of a sofa and of a divan, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of
the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were
modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make use of a sofa
and of a divan?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns made use of a … divan?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns make use of a sofa and of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.327" href="#BD.3.327"></a>
a divan? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this
rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should make use of a sofa or of a divan, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Sofa</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called of exceeding measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Divan</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is made having brought hair (stuffing).</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should make use of</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she sits down on it or lies down on it, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.42.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.42.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if, having cut down the legs of the sofa, she makes use of
it; if, having cut out the hair (stuffing) from the divan, she makes use of it;
if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
