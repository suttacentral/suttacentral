… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that
time nuns, as before, spent the rains in Rājagaha, the cold weather there, the
hot weather there. People … spread it about, saying: “The (four) quarters are
blocked, confused with nuns; because of them the (four) quarters are not seen.”
Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Then these nuns told this matter
to the monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. Then the lord, on this
occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“Because of this, monks, I will lay down a rule of training founded on ten
reasons: for the excellence of the Order … And thus, monks, let the nuns set
forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having kept the rains, should not set out on almstour, even for
(a distance of) five or six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.40.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.40.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having kept the rains</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having kept the first three months or the last three months.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks “I will not set out on almstour, even for (the distance of) five
or six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</p>

<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.323" href="#BD.3.323"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about for a nun
as a companion, she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are
accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
