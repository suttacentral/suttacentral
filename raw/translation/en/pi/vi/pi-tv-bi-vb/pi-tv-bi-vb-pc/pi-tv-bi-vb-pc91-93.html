… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns caused (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also caused
(themselves) to be massaged by a probationer … by a female novice … by a woman
householder. People, engaged in touring the dwelling-place, having seen (them),
… spread it about, saying: “How can <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.343" href="#Vin.4.343"></a>
these nuns cause (themselves) to be rubbed (with ointment) and also cause
(themselves) to be massaged by a probationer … by a female novice … by a woman
householder, just like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?”
Nuns heard … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc90#Bi-Pc.90.1">Bi-Pc.90.1</a></span> … “… this rule of training:</p>

cause (herself) to be massaged by a probationer … by a female novice … by a
woman householder, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
