… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā, not having given up her household robe, made use of it.
Other menstruating nuns did not obtain it. Those who were modest nuns … spread
it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, not having given up her
household robe, make use of it?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … makes use of it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … make use of it? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, not having given up her household robe, should make use of it,
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.47.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.47.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Household robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is given with the words: ‘Let menstruating nuns make use of it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Not having given up, should make use of it</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, having made use of it for two or three days, having washed it on the fourth
day, she makes use of it, not having given it up to a nun or to a probationer
or to a female novice, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.47.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.47.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is not given up when it is not given up (and) makes use
of it, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether it is
not given up … If she thinks that it is given up when <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.334" href="#BD.3.334"></a>
it is not given up … offence of expiation. If she thinks that it is not given
up when it is given up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt
as to whether it is given up, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks
that it is given up when it is given up, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.47.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.47.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if, having given it up, she makes use of it; if she makes
use of it on a further occasion; if there are no other menstruating nuns; if
she is one whose robe is stolen; if she is one whose robe is destroyed; if
there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.304" href="#Vin.4.304"></a></p>
