… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a man, a relative of a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī, set out from a
village for Sāvatthī on some business. Then that nun stood together with and
further talked with that man, the one with the other, in the dark of the night
when there was no light. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:
“How can this nun stand together with and further talk with a man, the one with
the other, in the dark of the night when there is no light?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … when there was no light?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun … when there was no light? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should stand together with or should talk with a man, the one with
the other, in the dark of the night when there is no light, there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>

expiation. If she stands or talks, having left (the space of) a reach of the
hand, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she stands together with or talks
with a <i lang="pi">yakkha</i> or a departed one or a eunuch or an animal in human form, there is an offence

There is no offence if some learned friend comes to be (present); if she, not
wishing for a private place, stands or talks thinking about something else; if
she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
