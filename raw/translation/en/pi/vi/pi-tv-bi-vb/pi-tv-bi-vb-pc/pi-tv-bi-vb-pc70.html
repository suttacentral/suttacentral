… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā, having ordained (the woman) who lived with her, neither
withdrew her nor had her withdrawn; her husband seized her. Those who were
modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, having
ordained (the woman) who lives with her, neither withdraw her nor have her
withdrawn? Her husband seized her. If this nun had departed her husband could
not have seized her.” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … nor had her
withdrawn (so that) her husband seized her?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor have her withdrawn (so that) her
husband seized her? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having ordained (the woman) who lives with her, should neither
withdraw her nor have her withdrawn even to (a distance of) five or six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.70.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.70.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">(Woman) who lives with her</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is called the one who shares her cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having ordained</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having conferred the upasampadā ordination. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.327" href="#Vin.4.327"></a>
</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.380" href="#BD.3.380"></a>
<span class="term">Should neither withdraw her</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should not herself withdraw her.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nor should have her withdrawn</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should not command another.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks: “I will neither withdraw her nor will I have her withdrawn even
to (a distance of) five or six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.70.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.70.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about for a nun
as a companion, she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are
accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
