… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained a girl married for less than twelve years. These were not able to
endure cold, heat, hunger, thirst, contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind and
sun, creeping things, abusive hurtful language; they were not able to endure
bodily feelings which arising are painful, acute, sharp, shooting,
disagreeable, miserable, deadly. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can nuns ordain a girl married for less than twelve years?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns ordained … married for less than
twelve years?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.322" href="#Vin.4.322"></a>
</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain a girl married for less than twelve years? Monks,
a girl married for less than twelve years is not able to endure cold … bodily
feelings … miserable, deadly. It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a girl married for less than twelve years, there is
an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.65.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.65.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.370" href="#BD.3.370"></a>
<span class="term">Less than twelve years</span> means:
<span class="gloss">not attained to twelve years.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Girl married</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one cohabiting with a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should ordain</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… <span class="add"><a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc61#Bi-Pc.61.2.1">Bi-Pc.61.2.1</a></span> … and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the woman teacher.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.65.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.65.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is less than twelve years when it is less than twelve
years (and) ordains her, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt
as to whether it is less than twelve years … offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that twelve years are completed when it is less than twelve years … no
offence. If she thinks that it is less than twelve years when twelve years are
completed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether
twelve years are completed, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks
that twelve years are completed when twelve years are completed, there is no
offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.65.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.65.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she ordains one (married) for less than twelve years
thinking that twelve years are completed; if she ordains one who has completed
twelve years thinking that they are completed; if she is mad, if she is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
