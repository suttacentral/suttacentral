… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained a pregnant woman. She walked for alms. People spoke thus: “Give
almsfood to the lady, the lady is heavy with child.” The people … spread it
about, saying: “How can the nuns ordain a pregnant woman?” Nuns heard these
people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying, “How can these nuns ordain a pregnant woman?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns ordained a pregnant woman?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain a pregnant woman? It is not, monks, for pleasing
those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain a pregnant woman, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.61.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.61.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Pregnant woman</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she is called entered by beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should ordain</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should confer the upasampada ordination.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks: “I will ordain (her)” and looks about for a group or for a woman
teacher or for a bowl or for a robe or if she determines a boundary, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. As a result of the motion there is an offence of
wrong-doing. As a result of two proclamations, there are offences of
wrong-doing. At the end of the proclamations, there is an offence of expiation
for <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.362" href="#BD.3.362"></a>
the woman preceptor, and an offence of wrong-doing for the group and for the
woman teacher.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.61.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.61.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that she is pregnant when she is pregnant (and) ordains her,
there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt … offence of wrong-doing.
If she thinks that she is not pregnant when she is pregnant, (and) ordains her,
there is no offence. If she thinks that she is pregnant when she is not
pregnant, <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.318" href="#Vin.4.318"></a>
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not
pregnant, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not
pregnant when she is not pregnant, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.61.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.61.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she ordains a pregnant woman thinking that she is not
pregnant; if she ordains a woman who is not pregnant thinking that she is not
pregnant; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
