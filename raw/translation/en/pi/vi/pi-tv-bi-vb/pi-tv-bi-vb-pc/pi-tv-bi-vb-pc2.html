… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the group of six nuns, haying let the hair of the body grow, bathed naked
together with prostitutes at the same ford of the river Aciravatī. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.260" href="#Vin.4.260"></a>
The prostitutes … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns let the hair of
the body grow, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns
heard these prostitutes who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns let the hair of the
body grow?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns let the hair of the
body grow?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns let the hair of the body grow? It is
not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should let the hair of the body grow, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Hair of the body</span> means:
<span class="gloss">under both armpits and on the private parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should let grow</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she lets one hair grow, there is an offence of expiation. If she lets many
hairs grow, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<p>There is no offence if it is because of illness, if she is mad, if she is the
first wrong-doer.</p>
