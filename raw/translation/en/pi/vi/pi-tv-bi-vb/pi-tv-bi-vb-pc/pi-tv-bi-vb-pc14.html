… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā, stood together with and talked with a man, the one with
the other, on a carriage road and in a cul-de-sac and at cross-roads, and she
whispered in his ear and she dismissed the nun who was her companion. Those who
were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā stand together with … at cross-roads, and whisper
in his ear and dismiss the nun who is her companion?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā stood together with …
and dismissed the nun who is her companion?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā stand together with … and dismiss the nun
who is her companion? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet)
pleased … this rule of training: <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.271" href="#Vin.4.271"></a>
</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should stand together with or should talk with a man, the one with
the other, on a carriage road or in a cul-de-sac or at cross-roads or should
whisper in his ear or should dismiss the nun who is her companion, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>
