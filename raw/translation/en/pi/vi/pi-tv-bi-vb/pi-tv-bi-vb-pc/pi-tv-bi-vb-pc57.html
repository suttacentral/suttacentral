… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
several nuns, having kept the rains in a village residence, went to Sāvatthī.
Nuns spoke thus to these nuns: “Where did the ladies keep the rains? Was an
Order of monks <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.314" href="#Vin.4.314"></a>
‘invited’?”</p>
<p>“Ladies, we did not ‘invite’ an Order of monks.” Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns, having spent the rains, not
‘invite’ an Order of monks?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … did not ‘invite’ an Order of
monks?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … not ‘invite’ an Order of monks? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having kept the rains, should not ‘invite’ both Orders in respect
of three matters: what was seen or heard or suspected, there is an offence of
expiation.”</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.57.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.57.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.57.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Having kept the rains</span> means:
<span class="gloss">having kept the first three months or the last three months.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will not ‘invite’ both Orders in respect of three matters:
what was seen or heard or <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.355" href="#BD.3.355"></a>
suspected,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of
expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.57.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.57.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about, she does
not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if
she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
