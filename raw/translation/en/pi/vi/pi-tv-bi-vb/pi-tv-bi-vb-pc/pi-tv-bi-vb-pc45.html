… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun, having approached the nun Thullanandā, spoke thus: “Do come,
lady, and settle this legal question.” The nun Thullanandā, having answered,
“Very good,” neither settled it nor made an effort to get it settled. Then that
nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, being spoken to by a nun, saying: ‘Do
come, lady, and settle this legal question,’ and having answered, ‘Very good,’
neither settle it nor make an effort to get it settled?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … to get it settled?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor make an effort to get it settled? It
is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, being spoken to by a nun, saying: ‘Do come, lady, and settle this
legal question,’ and having answered: ‘Very good,’ (yet) if she is not
afterwards prevented, should neither settle it nor should make an effort to get
it settled, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">By a nun</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Legal question</span> means:
<span class="gloss">there are four (kinds of) legal questions: legal questions arising out of
disputes, legal <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.331" href="#BD.3.331"></a>
questions arising out of censure, legal questions arising out of
transgressions, legal questions arising out of obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Do come, lady, and settle this legal question</span> means:
<span class="gloss">Do come, lady, and decide this legal question. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.302" href="#Vin.4.302"></a>

<p><span class="term">Nor should make an effort to get it settled</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should not command another.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will neither settle it nor make an effort to get it settled,”
in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</p>

If she thinks that she is ordained when she is ordained (and) neither settles a
legal question nor makes an effort to get it settled, there is an offence of
expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she is ordained … If she thinks
that she is not ordained when she is ordained … offence of expiation. If she
neither settles a legal question nor makes an effort to get it settled for one
who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she
is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If
she is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained … If she thinks that she is
not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.45.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.45.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if having looked about, she does
not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if
she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
