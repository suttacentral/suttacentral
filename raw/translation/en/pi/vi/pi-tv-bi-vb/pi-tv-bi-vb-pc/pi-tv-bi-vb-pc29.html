… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the family who supported the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā:
“If we, lady, are able, we will give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” Now
at that time nuns, having kept the rains-retreat, collected together wishing to
distribute robe-material. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to these nuns: “Wait,
ladies, there is for the Order of nuns an expectation of robe-material.” The
nuns spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “Do go, lady, and find out about this
robe-material.” The nun Thullanandā approached that family; having approached
she spoke thus to the people: “Sirs, do give robe-material for the Order of
nuns.” They said: “Lady, we are not able to give robe-material for the Order of
nuns.” The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest
nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, when an expectation of robe-material is not
sure, let the robe-season pass?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … let the robe-season
pass?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … let the robe-season pass? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, when an expectation of robe-material is not sure, should let the
robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">When an expectation of robe-material is not sure</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if they say, “If we are able, we will give, we will make,” (but their) word
becomes broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Robe-season</span> means:
<span class="gloss">the last month of the rainy season when the
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth is not (formally) made,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.287" href="#Vin.4.287"></a>
the five months when it is (formally) made.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should let the robe-season pass</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she lets pass the last day of the rainy season when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth is not (formally) made, there is an offence of expiation. If she lets
the day pass for removing the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges), there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.29.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.29.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that the robe-material is not sure when it is not sure (and) lets
the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as
to whether the robe-material is not sure … offence of wrong-doing. If she
thinks that the robe-material is sure when it is not sure … no offence. If she
thinks that the robe-material is not sure when it is sure, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether the robe-material is sure,
there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that the robe-material is
sure when it is sure, there is no offence.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.29.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.29.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she hinders having pointed out an advantage; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
