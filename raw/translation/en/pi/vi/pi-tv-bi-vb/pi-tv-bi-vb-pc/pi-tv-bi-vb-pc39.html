… at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that
time nuns walked on alms-tour during the rains. People … spread it about,
saying: “How can these nuns walk on almstour during the rains, trampling down
the crops and grasses, injuring life that is one-facultied, bringing many small
creatures to destruction?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those
who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these nuns … during the rains … bringing many small creatures to
destruction?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … during the rains … bringing many
small creatures to destruction?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns walk on almstour during the rains … bringing many small
creatures to destruction? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not
(yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should walk on almstour during the rains, there is an offence of
expiation.” <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.297" href="#Vin.4.297"></a>

<span class="term">During the rains</span> means:

<p><span class="term">Should walk on almstour</span> means:

There is no offence if she goes away for seven days because there is something
to be done; if she goes away because she is troubled about something; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
