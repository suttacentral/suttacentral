… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
nuns ordained while they were less than twelve years (of standing). They were
ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not
allowable; moreover, the women who’ shared their cells were ignorant,
inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable.
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns
ordain while they are less than twelve years (of standing)?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … less than twelve years (of
standing)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … less than twelve years (of standing)? It is not, monks,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should ordain while she is less than twelve years (of standing)
there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

There is no offence if she ordains when she has completed twelve years (of
standing); if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.330" href="#Vin.4.330"></a></p>
