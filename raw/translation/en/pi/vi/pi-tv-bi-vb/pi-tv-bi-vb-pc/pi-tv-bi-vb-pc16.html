… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the nun Thullanandā, having approached families after a meal, sat down on a
seat without having asked the owner (for permission) and moreover lay down on
it. People, being shy of the nun Thullanandā, neither sat down on that seat nor
lay down on it. The people … spread it about, saying: “How can the nun
Thullanandā, having approached families after a meal, sit down on a seat
without asking the owner (for permission) and moreover lie down on it?” Nuns
heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread
it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā … and moreover lie down on it?”
…</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … and moreover lay
down on it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … and moreover lie down on it? It is not,
monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having approached families after a meal, should sit down on or
should lie down on a seat without asking the owner (for permission), there is
an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

If she thinks that she has not asked (for permission) when she has not asked
(for permission) and sits down on or lies down on (a seat), there is an offence
of expiation. If she is in doubt as to whether she has not asked (for
permission) … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc15#Bi-Pc.15.2">Bi-Pc.15.2</a></span> … there is no offence.

There is no offence if she, asking (for permission), sits down on or lies down
on a seat; if it is a permanently appointed (seat); if she is ill; if there are
accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
