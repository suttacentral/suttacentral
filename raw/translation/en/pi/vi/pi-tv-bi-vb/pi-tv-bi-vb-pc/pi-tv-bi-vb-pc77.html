… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain probationer, having approached the nun Thullanandā, asked for the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination. The nun Thullanandā, having said to that probationer, “If you,
lady, will give me a robe, then will I ordain you,” neither ordained her nor
made an effort to get her ordained. Then that probationer told this matter to
the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the
lady Thullanandā, having said … neither ordain her nor make an effort to get
her ordained?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … nor made an effort
to get her ordained?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor make an effort to get her ordained?
It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of
training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun, having said to a probationer: ‘If you, lady, will give me a robe,
then will I ordain you,’ (yet) if she is not afterwards prevented, should
neither ordain her nor should make an effort to get her ordained, there is an
offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Probationer</span> means:
<span class="gloss">one who has trained for two years in the six rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">‘If you, lady, will give me a robe, then will I ordain you’</span> means:
<span class="gloss">then will I confer the <i lang="pi">upasampadā</i> ordination on you.</span></p>

<span class="term">If she is not afterwards prevented</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if there is not an obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should neither ordain her</span> means:
<span class="gloss">should not herself ordain her.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Nor should make an effort to get her ordained</span> means : should not command another.</p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will neither ordain her nor make an effort to get her
ordained,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of
expiation.</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.77.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.77.2.2"></a>
There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about, she does
not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if
she is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.333" href="#Vin.4.333"></a>
