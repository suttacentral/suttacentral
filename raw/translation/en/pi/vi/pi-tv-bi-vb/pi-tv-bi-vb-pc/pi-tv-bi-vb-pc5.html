… among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Then Mahāpajāpatī
the Gotamid approached the lord; having approached, having greeted the lord,
she stood to windward, saying: “Lord, the women smell nasty.” Then the lord,
saying: “Then let the nuns take an ablution with water,” roused … delighted
Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid, having been roused … delighted with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk by the lord, having greeted the lord, departed keeping her right side
towards him. Then the lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given
reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: “I allow, monks, an ablution with
water for the nuns.”</p>

<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.5.1.2" href="#Bi-Pc.5.1.2"></a>
Now at that time a certain nun, saying: “An ablution with water is allowed by
the lord,” taking a very deep ablution with water, got a sore on her private
parts. Then this nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns …
spread it about, saying: “How can this nun take a very deep ablution with
water?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun took a very deep ablution with
water?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun take a very deep ablution with water? It is not, monks,
for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">If a nun is taking an ablution with water, she may take at most (a measure of)
two finger-joints. For whoever exceeds this, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs-empty" id="Bi-Pc.5.2"></a>
<a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.5.2.1" href="#Bi-Pc.5.2.1"></a>
<span class="term">Ablution with water</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called washing the private parts.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.251" href="#BD.3.251"></a>
<span class="term">Is taking</span> means:
<span class="gloss">is washing.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">She may take at most (a measure of) two finger-joints</span> means:
<span class="gloss">she may take at most (a measure of) two joints of two fingers.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">For whoever exceeds this</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if she, enjoying the contact, exceeds by even a hair’s breadth, there is an
offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.5.2.2" href="#Bi-Pc.5.2.2"></a>
If she thinks that it is more when it is more than (a measure of) two
finger-joints (and) takes it, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in
doubt as to whether it is more than (a measure of) two finger-joints … If she
thinks that it is less when it is more than (a measure of) two finger-joints
(and) takes it, there is an offence <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.263" href="#Vin.4.263"></a>
of expiation. If she thinks that is is more when it is less than (a measure of)
two finger-joints, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to
whether it is less than (a measure of) two finger-joints, there is an offence
of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is less when it is less than (a measure
of) two finger-joints, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.5.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.5.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she takes at most (a measure of) two finger-joints; if
she takes less than at most (a measure of) two finger-joints; if it is because
of illness; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
