… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
the family who supported the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā:
“Lady, we will give robes for the Order of nuns.” The nun Thullanandā saying:
“You are very busy, there is much to be done,” put an obstacle in the way. Then
that family’s house was burnt down. They … spread it about, saying: “How could
the lady Thullanandā put an obstacle in the way of our gift of faith? We are
down and out; all round, both as to property and as to merit.” Nuns heard these
people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about,
saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā put an obstacle in the way of a group’s receiving
robes?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā put an obstacle in the
way of a group’s receiving robes?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā put an obstacle in the way of a group’s
receiving robes? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased
… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should put an obstacle in the way of a group’s receiving robes
there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<span class="term">A group</span> means:
<span class="gloss">it is called an Order of nuns.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Robe</span> means:
<span class="gloss">any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for
assignment. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.284" href="#Vin.4.284"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should put an obstacle in the way</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, saying: “How can this robe be given?” she puts an obstacle in the way,
there is an offence of expiation. If she puts an obstacle in the way of another
requisite, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she puts an obstacle in the
way of a robe or of another requisite for several nuns or for one nun or for a
woman who is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>

There is no offence if she hinders having pointed out an advantage; if she is
mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
