… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
robe-material had accrued to an Order of nuns not at a right time. Then that
Order of nuns collected together wishing to distribute that robe-material. Now
at that time the nuns who were pupils of the nun Thullanandā had gone out. The
nun Thullanandā spoke thus to those nuns: “Ladies, nuns are gone out; the
robe-material should not be distributed yet,” (and) she held back the division
of the robe-material. Nuns, saying: “The robe-material should not be
distributed yet,” parted company. When the nuns who were pupils returned, the
nun Thullanandā had that robe-material distributed. Those who were modest nuns
… spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā hold back a legally valid division of
robe-material?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that the nun Thullanandā held back a legally valid
division of robe-material?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā hold back a legally valid division of
robe-material? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …
this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should hold back a legally valid division of robe-material, there
is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Legally valid division of robe-material</span> means:
<span class="gloss">a complete Order of nuns, having collected together, distributes it. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.285" href="#Vin.4.285"></a>
</span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should hold back</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if, saying: “How could one distribute this robe-material?” she holds it back,
there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

If she thinks that it is legally valid when it is legally valid (and) holds
(the division) back, there is an offence of expiation. If she is in doubt as to
whether it is legally valid … offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is
not legally valid when it is legally valid … no offence. If she thinks that it
is legally valid when it is not legally valid, there is an offence of
wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is not legally valid, there is
an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is not legally valid when it
is not legally valid, there is no offence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bi-Pc.27.2.3" href="#Bi-Pc.27.2.3"></a>
There is no offence if she holds it back having pointed out an advantage; if
she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
