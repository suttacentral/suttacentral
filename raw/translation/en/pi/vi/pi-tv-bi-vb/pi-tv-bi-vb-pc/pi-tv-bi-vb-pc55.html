… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a certain nun, walking for alms along a certain road in Sāvatthī, approached a
certain family; having approached, she sat down on an appointed seat. Then
these people, having offered food to this nun, spoke thus: “Lady, other nuns
may also come.” Then this nun, thinking: “How may these nuns not come?” having
approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a place there are
fierce dogs, a wild bull, the place is a swamp, do not go there.” But a certain
nun, walking for alms along that road, approached that family; having
approached, she sat down on an appointed seat. Then these people, having
offered food to that nun, spoke thus: “Why do not the other nuns come, lady?”
Then this nun told this matter to those people. The people … spread it about,
saying: “How can that nun be grudging as to families?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun was grudging as to families?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun be grudging as to families? It is not, monks, for
pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should be one who is grudging as to families, there is an offence
of expiation.”</span></p>

<span class="term">Whatever</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.351" href="#BD.3.351"></a>
<span class="term">Family</span> means:
<span class="gloss">… low caste family. </span></p>
<p><span class="term">Should be one who is grudging as to families</span> means:
<span class="gloss">if they say, “Why do the nuns not come?” (and) she speaks dispraise of a family
in front of nuns, there is an offence of expiation. Or if she speaks dispraise
of nuns in front of a family, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

There is no offence if, not being grudging as to families, she merely explains
that there is a danger; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer. <a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.313" href="#Vin.4.313"></a></p>
