… at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time
a dwelling-place had been erected by a certain lay-follower for the Order. He,
at the festival for this dwelling-place, was desirous of giving robe-material
at the wrong time for both the Orders. Now at that time the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> cloth for both the Orders was (formally) made. Then that lay-follower, having
approached the Order, asked for the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges). They told this matter to the lord. Then the lord on this
occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks,
saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to remove the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges). And thus, monks, should the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) be removed: The Order should be informed by an experienced,
competent monk, saying: ‘Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. If it seems
right to the Order, let the Order remove the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges). This is the motion. Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me.
The Order removes the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges). If the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) is pleasing to the venerable ones, let them be silent. If it is
not pleasing, they should speak. The <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) are removed by the Order, and it is right … So do I understand
this.’”</p>

Then that lay-follower, having approached the Order of nuns, asked for the
removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges). The nun Thullanandā, thinking,
<a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.288" href="#Vin.4.288"></a>
“There will be
<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.3.303" href="#BD.3.303"></a>
robe-material for us,” held back the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges). Then that lay-follower … spread it about, saying: “How can these
nuns not give a removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges) for us?” Nuns heard that lay-follower who … spread it about.
Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the nun
Thullanandā hold back a legally valid removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges)?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā held back a legally
valid removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord “… <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc27#Bi-Pc.27.1">Bi-Pc.27.1</a></span> “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class="rule">Whatever nun should hold back a legally valid removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges), there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="term">Legally valid removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges)</span> means a complete Order of nuns, having collected together, remove them.</p>
<p><span class="term">Should hold back</span> means:

If she thinks that it is legally valid when it is legally valid (and) holds it
back … <span class="add">see <a class="cr" href="./pi-tv-bi-vb-pc27#Bi-Pc.27.2">Bi-Pc.27.2</a></span> … if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
