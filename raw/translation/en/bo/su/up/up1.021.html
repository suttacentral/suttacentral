<p>The narrative introduction is Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>Then a certain monk emerged from meditative seclusion and went to the place where the Blessed One <span class="add">was abiding</span>, arrived to <span class="add">that</span> place, paid homage with his head at the feet of the Blessed One and sat to one side. Sitting to one side, that monk asked the Blessed One this question: “It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dharma with a brief discourse in such a way that, having heard the Dharma in the form of a brief discourse in the presence of the Blessed One, I shall go to abide by myself, alone and in solitude, <span class="add">with an</span> immeasurable <span class="add">mind</span> and free from longing, collected in meditation. Once I have gone to abide by myself, alone and in solitude, <span class="add">with an</span> immeasurable <span class="add">mind</span> and free from longing, collected in meditation, Blessed One, please show me <span class="add">how to accomplish</span> the aim for whose sake a clansman’s son shaves off his hair and beard and puts Dharma robes on his body, and out of faith rightly having gone forth from the home life into homelessness, living the unsurpassed holy life, knowing in this present lifetime by himself that what had to be realised has been realised, that supreme knowledge <span class="add">has been attained, namely that</span> ‘Birth for me has been exhausted. The holy life has been fulfilled. What had to be done has been done. Existence other than the present one shall not be known <span class="add">by me</span>’.” That monk asked <span class="add">the Blessed One</span> this question <span class="add">and the Blessed One</span> replied: “It is well, monk, it is well!” The monk replied with these words: “It is well, it is well!”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><span class="add">The Blessed One asked:</span> “Monk, are you speaking like this, <span class="add">asking the Blessed One:</span> ‘Blessed One, please give me an exposition of the Dharma in a brief form so that after having heard the Dharma in a brief form in the presence of the Blessed One, I shall go to abide by myself, alone and in solitude, <span class="add">with an</span> immeasurable <span class="add">mind</span> and free from longing, collected in meditation. Once I have gone to abide by myself, alone and in solitude, <span class="add">with an</span> immeasurable <span class="add">mind</span> and free from longing, collected in meditation, <span class="add">I shall accomplish</span> the aim for whose sake a clansman’s son shaves off his hair and beard and puts Dharma robes on his body, and out of faith rightly having gone forth from the home life into homelessness, living the unsurpassed holy life, knowing in this present lifetime by himself that what had to be realised has been realised, that supreme knowledge <span class="add">has been attained, namely that</span> ‘Birth for me has been exhausted, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, existence other than the present one shall not be known <span class="add">by me</span>’” <span class="add">The monk replied:</span> “Yes, just like this, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><span class="add">The Blessed One said to the monk:</span> “Therefore, monk, listen carefully and keep <span class="add">it</span> in mind, and I shall explain. Monk, something that is not you should be relinquished by you. If you relinquish such a condition, for a long time there will be welfare, benefit and happiness.” <span class="add">Then the monk said to the Blessed One:</span> “I understood, Blessed One, I understood, Well Gone One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><span class="add">Then the Blessed One</span> asked <span class="add">the monk</span>: “Monk, are you able to grasp in full detail the meaning of the teaching I have given in brief?” <span class="add">The monk</span> replied: “Venerable sir, bodily form is not me, if I relinquish such a thing, for a long time there will be welfare, benefit and happiness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Feeling, perception, formations, consciousness surely are not ‘me’. On relinquishing such things, for a long time there will be welfare, benefit and happiness. Venerable sir, in this way I understand in full detail the meaning of the teaching given in brief by the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“It is well, monk, it is well! It is well, monk, that you are able to grasp in full detail the meaning of the teaching I have given in brief. What is the reason? Monk, bodily form is not-self. You have to abandon such a thing. When such a thing is abandoned by you, for a long time there will be welfare, benefit and happiness. Feeling, perception, formations, consciousness are not-self. You have to abandon such things. When such things are abandoned by you, for a long time there will be welfare, benefit and happiness.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>Then, on hearing what the Blessed One had said, that monk was greatly delighted in his mind, and after paying homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he left the presence of the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>Then after the Blessed One had instructed that monk with this teaching in a brief form, <span class="add">that monk</span> went to abide by himself, alone and in solitude, <span class="add">with an</span> immeasurable <span class="add">mind</span> and free from longing, collected in meditation. While abiding by himself, alone and in solitude, <span class="add">with an</span> immeasurable <span class="add">mind</span> and free from longing, collected in meditation, <span class="add">he accomplished</span> the aim for whose sake a clansman’s son shaves off his hair and beard and puts Dharma robes on his body, and out of faith rightly goes forth from the home life into homelessness, living the unsurpassed holy life, knowing in this present lifetime by himself that what had to be realised has been realised, that supreme knowledge <span class="add">has been attained, namely that</span> “Birth for me has been exhausted, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, existence other than the present one shall not be known <span class="add">by me</span>,” that venerable one became an arahant, endowed with liberation of the mind.</p>
