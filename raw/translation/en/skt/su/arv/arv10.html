<h1>10. The Four Spiritual States</h1>
</div>
<p><span class="add">(Herein, monastics,)</span> what are the four spiritual states? </p>
<p>Here, monastics, a monk <span class="add">(1)</span> endowed with friendliness, with a mind free from hatred, enmity and ill-will, which is lofty, extensive, undiscriminating,  immeasureable, well-developed, with <span class="add">(a mind)</span> liberated through concentration he abides pervading one direction <span class="add">(with friendliness)</span>, so for the second <span class="add">(direction)</span>, so for the third <span class="add">(direction)</span>, so for the fourth <span class="add">(direction)</span>, and so in the highest <span class="add">(direction)</span>, the lowest <span class="add">(direction)</span> and across the whole world in all quarters, <span class="add">(he abides)</span> having friendliness, with a mind free from hatred, enmity and ill-will, which is lofty, extensive, undiscriminating, immeasureable, well-developed, with <span class="add">(a mind)</span> liberated through concentration he abides pervading one direction <span class="add">(with friendliness)</span>.</p>
<p>So, <span class="add">(2)</span> having kindness... <span class="add">(3)</span> having gladness... <span class="add">(4)</span> having equanimity… with a mind free from hatred, enmity and ill-will, which is lofty, extensive, <span class="add">undiscriminating,</span> immeasureable, well-developed, with <span class="add">(a mind)</span> liberated through concentration he abides pervading one direction <span class="add">(with equanimity)</span>.</p>
<p>These, monastics, are the four spiritual states. </p>
