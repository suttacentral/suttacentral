<h1>23. The Four Confidences</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the four confidences of a Realised One?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>‘Here while claiming he is the Gracious One, the Realised One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha, he doesn’t have knowledge of these things.’ In whatever respect this is being said, in the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation, with its ascetics and brahmins, princes, men and demons, there is no ground for it to be regarded in this way.</p>
<p>Not seeing any ground <span class="add">(for that)</span> the Realised One dwells, having attained safety, having attained fearlessness, he knows the leader’s position, and having rightly gone to the assembly he roars the lion’s roar, he has set rolling the supreme <span class="add">(Dharma)</span> wheel, and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin, or by anyone in the world, in accordance with the Dharma. </p></li>
<li><p>‘These things which you declare to be an obstacle they are surely not obstacles for one who practices them.’ In whatever respect… and the elaboration <span class="add">(as before)</span>. </p></li>
<li><p>‘That that practice declared by me to my disciples, which is noble, leading to emancipation, when practiced doesn’t lead out for that one who practices it, and to the destruction of suffering.’ In whatever respect… as before. </p></li>
<li><p>‘Here while claiming to be without pollutants himself, these pollutants are not fully destroyed.’ In whatever respect this is being said, in the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation, with its ascetics and brahmins, princes, men and demons, there is no ground for it to be regarded in this way.</p>
<p>Not seeing any ground <span class="add">(for that)</span> the Realised One dwells, having attained safety, having attained fearlessness, he knows the leader’s position, and having rightly gone to the assembly he roars the lion’s roar, he has set rolling the supreme <span class="add">(Dharma)</span> wheel, and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin, or by anyone in the world, in accordance with the Dharma. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are the four confidences of a Realised One.</p>
