<h1>18. The Seven Factors of Awakening</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the seven factors of awakening?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The factor of awakening that is mindfulness, </li>
<li>the factor of awakening that is investigation of the <span class="add">(nature of)</span> things,</li>
<li>the factor of awakening that is energy,</li>
<li>the factor of awakening that is joy,</li>
<li>the factor of awakening that is tranquillity,</li>
<li>the factor of awakening that is concentration,</li>
<li>the factor of awakening that is equanimity.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Here, monastics, a monastic cultivates the factor of awakening that is mindfulness, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment.</p></li>
<li><p>He cultivates the factor of awakening that is investigation of the <span class="add">(nature of)</span> things, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment.</p></li>
<li><p>He cultivates the factor of awakening that is energy, depending on solitude, depending on dispassion, depending on cessation, maturing in relinquishment.</p></li>
