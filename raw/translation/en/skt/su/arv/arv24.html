<h1>24. The Four Analytical Knowledges</h1>
</div>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the four analytical knowledges?</p>
<p>They are as follows: </p>
<ol><li>The analytical knowledge of meaning, </li>
<li>the analytical knowledge of the way things are, </li>
<li>the analytical knowledge of language, </li>
<li>the analytical knowledge of inspired speech. </li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>The analytical knowledge of meaning is what? </p>
<p>That is to say, the unchanging knowledge of the ultimate truth. </p></li>
<li><p>The analytical knowledge of the way things are is what?</p>
<p>The unchanging knowledge of things without pollutants. </p></li>
<li><p>The analytical knowledge of language is what?</p>
<p>The unchanging knowledge of utterances.</p></li>
<li><p>The analytical knowledge of inspired speech is what? </p>
<p>What is suitable and facile talk: the unchanging and clear knowledge one dwelling in concentration has <span class="add">(of this)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are the four analytical knowledges.</p>
