<h1>Discourse to Katyāyana</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a>The Bhagavan was staying in Nādikā in the Guñjakā House.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a>Venerable Faithful-Kātyāyana went to the Bhagavan. Having approached, he saluted the Bhagavan’s feet with his head, and stood to one side. Standing to one side Faithful Kātyāyana said this to the Bhagavan:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a>“‘Right-view, right view’ is said Sir. In what way is there rightview? To what extent does the Tathāgata teach the understanding of right-view?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a>That said, the bhagavan said to Faithful Kātyāyana:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a>“Generally, Kātyāyana, this world relies on a duality of existence and non-existence. This world which relies on existence and non-existence is attached, grasping and bound. And this obstinate tendency of the mind to grasp and cling they don’t hold, they don’t accept, insist on or have a tendency to say: this is my self. This arising is disappointment arising; ceasing is disappointment ceasing—here he has no doubt, no uncertainty, and has independent knowledge of this.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a>“In this way there is right-view, Kātyāyana. In this way the Tathāgata teaches the understanding of right-view.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a>“Why is that? Arising in the world, Kātyayana, seen and correctly understood just as it is, <span class="add">shows</span> there is no non-existence in the world. Cessation in the world, Kātyayana, seen and correctly understood just as it is, <span class="add">shows</span> there is no <span class="add">permanent</span> existence in the world.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a>“Thus avoiding both extremes the Tathāgata teaches a dharma by the middle path.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a>“That is: this being, that becomes; with the arising of this, that arises. With ignorance as condition there is volition ...” <span class="add">as before for arising and cessation</span>.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a>While hearing this exposition of the Dharma the mind of venerable Faithful Kātyāyana was liberated from the taints through non-clinging.</p>
